<break time="0.5s"/>The sun was<break time="2s"/> setting in the west.<break time="2s"/>
The sixth day was over<break time="2s"/> and the seventh day was beginning.<break time="2s"/>
God was finished<break time="2s"/> making this world.<break time="2s"/>
It was time<break time="2s"/> for a big celebration.<break time="2s"/>
The angel choir sang<break time="2s"/> beautiful music to praise God.<break time="2s"/>

God rested on<break time="2s"/> the seventh day.<break time="2s"/>
He blessed the day<break time="2s"/> and made it special.<break time="2s"/>
He called it the Sabbath.<break time="1.8s"/>
It was always to<break time="2s"/> be a rest day.<break time="2s"/>
It was to be a day to<break time="2s"/> enjoy all the things that God had made.<break time="2s"/>
It was a<break time="2s"/> day to worship God,<break time="2s"/>
the Creator.<break time="1s"/>

God came down to the Garden of Eden<break time="2s"/> to spend the first Sabbath with Adam and Eve.<break time="2s"/>
They walked in<break time="2s"/> the garden together.<break time="2s"/>
Adam and Eve asked God questions<break time="2s"/> about the things He had created.<break time="2s"/>
They looked at the<break time="2s"/> beautiful trees and flowers.<break time="2s"/>
They listened to<break time="2s"/> the singing birds.<break time="2s"/>
What a happy day the<break time="2s"/> first Sabbath was! God was happy,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

God wants us to remember<break time="2s"/> the special day He created.<break time="2s"/>
He wants us<break time="2s"/> to enjoy every Sabbath.<break time="2s"/>
