The captain woke him up and asked<break time="2s"/> him to pray to his God for help.<break time="2s"/>
Then they cast lots to see<break time="2s"/> who had made the gods angry.<break time="2s"/>
The lot fell on Jonah.<break time="1.8s"/>

Jonah admitted that he was<break time="2s"/> running away from his God.<break time="2s"/>
“Throw me out<break time="2s"/> into the sea,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
They waited for a while to<break time="2s"/> see if the storm would calm down,<break time="2s"/>
but it did not.<break time="1.3s"/>
Sadly,<break time="0.5s"/>

As Jonah went down,<break time="1.3s"/>
down into the sea he<break time="2s"/> suddenly felt something warm around him.<break time="2s"/>
He was being swallowed<break time="2s"/> by a huge fish.<break time="2s"/>

For one whole day and parts of<break time="2s"/> two other days Jonah was inside the fish.<break time="2s"/>
