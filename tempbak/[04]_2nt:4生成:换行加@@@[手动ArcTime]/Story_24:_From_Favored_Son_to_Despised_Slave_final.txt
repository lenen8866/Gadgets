Joseph fell down,
down into the well.
There was no
 water in this well,
but it was deep.@@@

After the brothers pushed
 Joseph into the well,
they heard him crying and
 begging them to take him out.
But they just went away and
 sat down to eat their lunch.
Joseph was hungry,
but they didn’t
 give him any food.@@@

Down in the
 valley below them,
they saw a long line of
 camels walking along the dusty road.
“I think the men on those camels are
 going to Egypt to sell spices and slaves,
” said one brother.@@@

Judah jumped up.
“I have an
 idea!” he said.
“Let’s sell Joseph
 for a slave.
Then we’ll get some money.
Joseph won’t die.
After all,
he is our brother.@@@

“That’s a good
 idea!” said another brother.
“Joseph must never
 see Father again.
He would tell on us.
We must get
 rid of him.@@@

They hurried to the
 well and pulled Joseph out.
The camels were
 getting very near now.
The brothers waved
 for them to stop.@@@

When Joseph heard what his
 brothers were planning to do,
he started to cry again.
“Please don’t sell me! Don’t make me a
 slave! Think of our dear father at home.
” But they wouldn’t listen.
They sold Joseph for
 twenty pieces of silver.@@@

The men gave the
 money to the brothers.
Then they grabbed Joseph and
 chained him to some other slaves.@@@

“That’s the last we’ll
 see of the dreamer,
” the brothers said.
They watched the
 camels leave with Joseph.@@@

The caravan of
 camels moved on.
Joseph was sad.
How could he be a slave? He
 had always had his father’s loving care.@@@

The camels went southward.
After travelling several days,
Joseph could see the
 place where his home was.
Over there,
not so far away,
his father was waiting.
He was waiting for
 Joseph to come home.
How sad Jacob would be when he
 found that Joseph was not coming home.@@@

The trip was hard
 and long for Joseph.
For nearly twelve days the men with the
 camels and slaves travelled over the hot desert sands.
Joseph was very
 tired and hot.@@@

He thought about the things he
 had planned to do for God.
Now he would
 be a slave.
He thought of his dreams.
“I’m sure God
 gave them to me,
” he said.
“I’m sure He has a
 special plan for my life.@@@

Then he thought of the stories Grandfather
 Isaac and Father Jacob had told him.
He remembered how God had talked
 to Grandfather Isaac and to his father.
He remembered how God
 had cared for them.
“God will care for me,
too,
” Joseph thought.@@@

Right then Joseph decided.
“I will always trust God,
no matter what
 happens to me.
” Joseph was brave
 and wiped away his tears.
