They were all<break time="2s"/> looking at Pharaoh.<break time="2s"/>
They were thinking,<break time="1s"/>

Pharaoh said,<break time="1s"/>
“I had two<break time="2s"/> very strange dreams.<break time="2s"/>
I cannot rest until<break time="2s"/> I know what they mean.<break time="2s"/>
In my first dream I<break time="2s"/> was standing by the Nile River.<break time="2s"/>
I saw seven cows<break time="2s"/> come out of the river.<break time="2s"/>
They were nice fat cows.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Then seven more<break time="2s"/> cows came out.<break time="2s"/>
There have never been such<break time="2s"/> ugly cows in all Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
They were so skinny that all<break time="2s"/> their bones seemed to be sticking out.<break time="2s"/>

“Then a very<break time="2s"/> strange thing happened.<break time="2s"/>
The skinny cows ate<break time="2s"/> up the fat cows.<break time="2s"/>
