Many people came to
 see what Noah was doing.
He told them that water
 would fall from the sky.
So much rain would fall that the whole
 earth would be covered by a flood of water.@@@

“Rain! What’s rain?”
 the people asked.
No one had
 ever seen rain.
Since the creation of the
 earth hundreds of years before,
God had watered
 the earth with dew.
But Noah knew
 rain would come.
God had said it would.@@@

There was much
 work to be done.
It would take many
 years to finish the ark.
Inside,
cages and rooms
 must be built.
Food would have to be taken into
 the ark for the people and animals.@@@

At first,
Noah’s preaching made
 the people afraid.
They watched the
 sky for rain.
Days and weeks
 and years went by.
Still it did not rain.
People began to
 make fun of Noah,
but that didn’t stop him.
He was too
 busy obeying God.@@@

There were people who
 helped Noah build the ark.
His father and
 his brothers helped.
His three young sons,
Shem,
Ham,
and Japheth helped,
too.
During the many
 years of ark-building,
Noah’s sons grew
 up and got married.@@@

After one hundred and
 twenty years of work,
the ark was finished.
It was so big people
 could see it from far away.
Noah had done what
 God had told him.@@@

Noah had preached to the people about the
 flood all the years he was building the ark.
Now he said,
“Please come in.
The door is still open.
” Some people thought
 they should go in,
but they were afraid their
 friends would laugh at them.
So they joined in
 making fun of Noah.@@@

“Noah is a
 crazy old man,
” the people were saying.
“Yes,
he thinks this heavy
 boat will float on water.@@@

Suddenly the joking
 and fun stopped.
People looked toward
 the hills and forests.
Animals were coming.
Farm animals were coming.
Wild animals were coming,
too.@@@

The animals walked
 to the ark.
Then up the ramp they went and
 into the ark through the big door.
The wild animals and the
 tame animals walked side by side.
Male and female animals came.
Two of some animals
 came and seven of others.
They did not
 crowd or push.
Angels were leading them,
but the people could
 not see the angels.@@@

The news about the
 animals was heard everywhere.
People came to
 see the strange sight.
For one week the
 animals walked into the ark.
Then one day the sky was
 filled with all kinds of birds—birds flying,
flying,
into the ark.
Angels were leading them too.
