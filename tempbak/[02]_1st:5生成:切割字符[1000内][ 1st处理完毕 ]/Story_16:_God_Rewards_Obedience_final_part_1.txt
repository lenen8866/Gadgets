<break time="0.5s"/>When all the animals and<break time="2s"/> birds were inside the ark,<break time="2s"/>
God said,<break time="1s"/>
“Go into the ark,<break time="1.3s"/>
Noah.<break time="0.5s"/>
Take your family in,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

Noah felt very sorry for<break time="2s"/> the people outside the ark.<break time="2s"/>
“I wish they<break time="2s"/> would listen to me,<break time="2s"/>
” he thought sadly.<break time="1.3s"/>
Then he went inside<break time="2s"/> the ark where his wife,<break time="2s"/>
his three sons and<break time="2s"/> their wives were waiting.<break time="2s"/>

There was a<break time="2s"/> flash of light.<break time="2s"/>
An angel had come from heaven to<break time="2s"/> close the heavy door of the ark.<break time="2s"/>
Slowly the door<break time="2s"/> began to swing shut.<break time="2s"/>
Then it was closed.<break time="1.3s"/>
