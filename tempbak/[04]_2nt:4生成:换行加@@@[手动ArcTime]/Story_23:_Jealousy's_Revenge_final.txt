It was a
 very busy morning.
Joseph’s older brothers were
 going on a long trip.
The grass around the place
 where they were living was gone.
The sheep and goats
 had nothing to eat.
The brothers were taking
 the animals to Shechem,
a place far away where
 there was a lot of grass.
Donkeys were loaded with
 water bags and food.@@@

Jacob called the family together.
He asked God to care for his
 sons and the animals on their long trip.@@@

Days and weeks went by.
The brothers were gone
 for a long time.
Father Jacob began to
 wonder what was happening.@@@

“I am worried
 about your brothers,
” Jacob said to Joseph.
“Maybe something is wrong.
I want you to
 go and find them.@@@

Joseph put on his coat,
took his lunch and
 some food for his brothers.
Then he kissed his
 father and Benjamin good-bye.@@@

Joseph walked and walked.
He sang songs
 and talked to God.
He thought about things he would like
 to do for God when he was older.
At night he lay down
 under the stars to sleep.
He knew God
 was near him,
and he was not afraid.@@@

When he got to Shechem
 where his brothers had gone,
they were not there.
He looked and looked,
but he could
 not find them.
A man saw Joseph
 walking around in a field.
He told Joseph that his
 brothers had gone to Dothan.@@@

Poor Joseph! He was so tired!
 But he must find his brothers.
Father would be waiting
 to hear how they were.
The sun was hot.
He was hungry and thirsty.
As he walked he hoped it would
 not take too long to get to Dothan.@@@

At last he saw
 some tents far away.
He walked faster.
Yes! He was sure
 those were his brothers’ tents.
He was so happy.@@@

Joseph did not know that
 his brothers had seen him.
He was wearing
 his bright coat,
so they knew
 it was Joseph coming.@@@

“Here comes the dreamer,
” said one brother.@@@

“Let’s get rid of him,
” said another.@@@

Reuben was the oldest brother.
He said,
“No,
don’t hurt him.
He is our brother.
Throw him down that
 dry well over there.
” Reuben thought,
“Later I will help him
 get out of the well.
Then he can
 go back home.@@@

Joseph ran the last little
 way to his brothers’ tents.
He waved happily,
but the brothers
 did not wave back.
Joseph looked from one
 brother to the other.
There were no
 smiles of welcome.
His brothers’ faces
 looked angry and mean.
Joseph was afraid.@@@

They grabbed him.
They tore off
 his beautiful coat.
Then they pulled him
 to the old well.@@@

“I brought you
 food from father,
” he said.
“Father sent me to you.
Oh,
please don’t hurt me.@@@

“Now we’ll see what
 happens to those dreams,
” the brothers said.
And they pushed
 him down the well.
