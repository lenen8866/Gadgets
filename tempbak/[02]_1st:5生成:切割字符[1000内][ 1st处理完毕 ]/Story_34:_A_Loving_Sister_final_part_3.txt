She did not know that angels were guiding the princess<break time="2s"/> to the very spot where the basket was rocking gently.<break time="2s"/>

Suddenly Miriam heard voices! Were soldiers<break time="2s"/> near? Miriam’s heart beat very fast.<break time="2s"/>
She listened.<break time="1s"/>
No,<break time="0.5s"/>
not soldiers.<break time="1s"/>
She heard happy women’s voices.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then she saw the beautiful princess<break time="2s"/> and her maids walking to the river.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam watched them from among<break time="2s"/> the reeds where she was standing.<break time="2s"/>

Miriam was afraid.<break time="1s"/>
But the princess<break time="2s"/> had a kind face.<break time="2s"/>
