<break time="0.5s"/>After Adam and Eve ate the<break time="2s"/> fruit they began to feel afraid.<break time="2s"/>
The clothes of light that<break time="2s"/> God had given them were gone.<break time="2s"/>
That evening when God<break time="2s"/> came to the garden,<break time="2s"/>
Adam and Eve tried<break time="2s"/> to hide in some bushes.<break time="2s"/>

God called Adam and Eve.<break time="1.8s"/>
He asked,<break time="1s"/>
“Did you eat fruit from the forbidden tree?”<break time="2s"/> Adam told God that Eve made him do it.<break time="2s"/>
Eve blamed the snake.<break time="1.3s"/>
God was sad.<break time="1s"/>
But He spoke<break time="2s"/> kindly to His children.<break time="2s"/>
“You will have<break time="2s"/> to leave the garden.<break time="2s"/>
You and all<break time="2s"/> living things will die.<break time="2s"/>
” So Adam and Eve<break time="2s"/> sadly left their beautiful garden home.<break time="2s"/>
