At last Eliezer got to Haran and stopped<break time="2s"/> to rest his camels at the village well.<break time="2s"/>
It was evening,<break time="1s"/>

Eliezer didn’t know anyone.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Please,<break time="0.5s"/>
God,<break time="0.5s"/>
help me to find<break time="2s"/> the right wife for Isaac.<break time="2s"/>
Let it be that when I ask<break time="2s"/> the right woman to give me a drink,<break time="2s"/>
she will answer,<break time="1s"/>
‘Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
and I’ll give<break time="2s"/> water to your camels,<break time="2s"/>
