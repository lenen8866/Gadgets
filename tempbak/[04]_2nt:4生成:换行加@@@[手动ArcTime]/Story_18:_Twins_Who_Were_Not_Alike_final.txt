One happy day Isaac
 and Rebekah had twins.
Two little boys!
 Rebekah was not surprised.
An angel had told her she would have twin
 sons and the older one would serve the younger.
Esau was born first.@@@

The two little
 boys were very different.
Esau liked to
 play rough games.
He liked to go out
 in the fields and forests.
He liked to go hunting.
Isaac loved Esau best.@@@

Jacob was quiet and
 liked being at home.
He liked taking care of
 the sheep and planting a garden.
He liked to hear Grandfather Abraham
 tell stories about the God of heaven.
Rebekah loved Jacob best.@@@

In those times,
in each family,
the first boy born
 was to get the birthright.
That meant that he would be the
 one to help his family worship God.
Esau,
the firstborn,
did not care
 much about the birthright.
Jacob,
the younger son,
often wished that he
 could have the birthright.@@@

The boys grew
 to be young men.
One day Jacob was
 making some good food.
He was cooking some lentils.
Esau came back from
 hunting and was very hungry.
He came right to Jacob’s
 tent where the food was cooking.
“I’m very hungry,
” he told his brother,
“Please give me
 some of your food.@@@

Jacob got an idea.
“Yes,
” he said
 to his brother.
“Give me your birthright and you
 can have all the food you want.
” Right then,
Esau cared more about getting
 food than having the birthright.
So he said yes.
Jacob gave him the food.@@@

Many years passed by before
 Esau remembered about the birthright again.
He did not
 care about God,
but Jacob loved
 the God of heaven.
