Mother held Moses close as she
 carried him home from the river.
Miriam skipped happily
 beside her mother.@@@

The family was glad
 that their baby was safe.
They knelt in prayer—and thanked God
 for His loving care over Baby Moses.@@@

Now Miriam could take
 him outside for a walk.
No one would hurt him.
The family knew that someday
 Moses would have to go away.
He would have to go to
 live in Pharaoh’s palace with the princess.@@@

As Moses grew bigger,
Mother Jochabed taught
 him many things.
She taught him
 to read and write.
She taught him about the God
 of heaven who created the world.
She taught him to
 love God very much.
She told him that God
 had a special plan for him.
Father Amram and Sister
 Miriam taught him too.@@@

The family in the
 little mud-brick house was happy.
They sang songs
 and prayed together.
They never forgot how God
 had saved their little boy.
Moses and Aaron
 had fun playing.
The family walked to the Nile River and showed
 Moses where he had floated in a little basket.@@@

Birthdays for Moses
 came and went.
Then one day
 Moses had another birthday.
He was twelve years old.
It was time for him
 to go away to the palace.
The family would
 miss him very much.
Moses would miss his family,
too.
But he was brave.
He knew God would
 take care of him.@@@

Before Moses left,
the family prayed.
They thanked God for letting
 them have Moses for twelve years.
Mother Jochabed prayed.@@@

Father Amram prayed.
Moses prayed too.
He needed God
 to be near him.
God would help him
 to do the right things.
He promised to
 love God always.@@@

Maybe Moses went to the palace
 in one of Pharaoh’s big chariots.
It was an
 exciting time for him.
The palace was
 big and very beautiful.
Moses went all over the big
 palace and out into the lovely gardens.
He was a happy boy and
 he helped to make others happy.
The princess loved Moses.
Pharaoh loved him too.
They wanted him to be
 the king of Egypt some day.@@@

Moses learned many
 things in the palace.
He learned about
 the laws of Egypt.
He learned how
 to be a soldier.
He learned to
 drive the chariots.@@@

The priests tried to teach
 Moses about the gods of Egypt.
But Moses kept his promise to be true to
 the God of heaven and prayed to Him every day.
