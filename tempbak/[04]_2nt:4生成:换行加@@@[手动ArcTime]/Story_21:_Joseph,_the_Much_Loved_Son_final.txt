Jacob had a big family.
There were eleven
 boys and one girl.
Joseph was the youngest.
They knew there would
 be a new baby soon.
That made Joseph
 feel very happy.
He would have
 someone to play with.
Sometimes his older brothers
 were not kind to him.
The family was travelling.
They were soon going
 to see Grandfather Isaac.
They would live near him.
That’s where Father Jacob had lived
 when he was a little boy.@@@

First,
it was time to stop
 at Bethel for a few days.
Joseph was very happy
 to be at Bethel.
He held his father’s hand as they
 walked around looking for a special place.
Joseph was excited.
“Where was it,@@@

“I think it
 was right about here,
son.
” Jacob’s eyes were shining.
“The rock was
 a very hard pillow.
But I’ll never
 forget the dream.
The angels were so beautiful.
God was right
 here with me.@@@

“Oh,
Father,
I wish God would give
 me a dream like that,
” Joseph said.@@@

“Keep loving God,
Joseph,
” answered Father.
“Keep praying every day.@@@

Soon it was
 time to leave Bethel.
It would not be much
 farther to Grandfather Isaac’s home.@@@

Joseph could hardly wait.
He had never
 seen his grandfather.
There were special stories
 he wanted to hear.
He had heard the stories
 many times from his father,
but he wanted to
 hear them from Grandfather himself.@@@

Grandfather Isaac was blind.
How happy he was to have his family living
 near him! Joseph loved to go to Grandfather’s tent.
He listened to his
 stories over and over again.
The best stories were about when
 God talked to Abraham and Isaac.@@@

“Oh,
I wish God would talk
 to me!” Joseph jumped up,
kissed Grandfather Isaac and ran
 home to his own tent.@@@

Joseph was busy every
 day at his new home.
The family had
 many sheep and goats.
The animals needed
 grass to eat.
Joseph and his brothers had to
 find places where there was grass.
Then they had to
 care for the animals.
Joseph played with
 his new little brother,
Benjamin,
too.
He missed his
 mother very much.
She had died when
 Baby Benjamin was born.
Jacob and Joseph often
 talked about Mother Rachel.@@@

Joseph loved the little lambs.
He was very
 kind to them.
But his brothers
 were not kind.
And they were not careful.
If a lamb got lost,
they did not care.
This made Joseph sad.
He told his
 father about it.
That made the
 brothers angry at Joseph.@@@

Jacob loved Joseph the
 best of all his sons.
He made a
 special coat for Joseph.
It was the kind of
 coat that kings and princes wear.
It was a coat
 with many pretty colors.@@@

Jacob gave the
 coat to Joseph.
How happy he was! He
 liked to feel the soft cloth.
The bright colors
 made him feel good.
Benjamin liked the coat,
too.
He smiled as
 he touched the coat.@@@

However,
the other brothers
 were not happy.
“Why should Joseph wear the
 coat of a prince?” they asked.
The brothers were
 jealous of Joseph.
