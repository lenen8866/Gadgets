<break time="0.5s"/>Moses lived in<break time="2s"/> the king’s palace.<break time="2s"/>
His princess mother taught him how<break time="2s"/> to live in his new home.<break time="2s"/>
He grew to<break time="2s"/> be a man.<break time="2s"/>
Even though Pharaoh’s family didn’t<break time="2s"/> worship the God of heaven,<break time="2s"/>
Moses loved God and<break time="2s"/> prayed to Him every day.<break time="2s"/>

One night angels<break time="2s"/> talked to Moses.<break time="2s"/>
They told him God wanted<break time="2s"/> him to help the Israelite people.<break time="2s"/>
Someday Moses would help<break time="2s"/> the people to be free.<break time="2s"/>
They would not<break time="2s"/> be slaves any more.<break time="2s"/>

Moses was a<break time="2s"/> good soldier now.<break time="2s"/>
He thought maybe God wanted him<break time="2s"/> to fight to save the people.<break time="2s"/>
He went to<break time="2s"/> visit the Israelites.<break time="2s"/>
He felt sad when he<break time="2s"/> saw the slave masters hurting them.<break time="2s"/>

One day Moses saw a slave<break time="2s"/> master hit an Israelite slave very hard.<break time="2s"/>
Moses got angry.<break time="1s"/>
He killed the slave master.<break time="1.8s"/>
But that was not the<break time="2s"/> way God wanted him to help.<break time="2s"/>

Somebody told the king<break time="2s"/> what Moses had done.<break time="2s"/>

King Pharaoh was angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
Moses was afraid and<break time="2s"/> ran away from the palace.<break time="2s"/>
He ran away from Egypt.<break time="1.8s"/>
He felt sad.<break time="1s"/>
He thought that now God could<break time="2s"/> not use him to help the people.<break time="2s"/>
He knew it was wrong<break time="2s"/> to kill the slave master.<break time="2s"/>
He prayed,<break time="1s"/>
“Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
God,<break time="0.5s"/>
please forgive me.<break time="1s"/>
” God heard his prayer.<break time="1.8s"/>
He cared for Moses<break time="2s"/> as he ran away.<break time="2s"/>

Moses ran far<break time="2s"/> away from Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He came to<break time="2s"/> a place called Midian.<break time="2s"/>
He was very tired,<break time="1.3s"/>
so he sat down<break time="2s"/> to rest by a well.<break time="2s"/>

Soon he saw seven young<break time="2s"/> ladies coming to the well.<break time="2s"/>
They were bringing sheep to<break time="2s"/> the well to drink water.<break time="2s"/>
Soon other shepherds came.<break time="1.3s"/>
They pushed the girls away and started<break time="2s"/> to get water for their own sheep.<break time="2s"/>

“Stop!” Moses told the shepherds.<break time="1.8s"/>
“The ladies were here first.<break time="1.8s"/>
” Then Moses helped the<break time="2s"/> girls give water to the sheep.<break time="2s"/>

The girls said,<break time="1s"/>
“Thank you,<break time="1s"/>
” to Moses.<break time="1s"/>
Then they went<break time="2s"/> home with their sheep.<break time="2s"/>

Their father,<break time="1s"/>
Jethro,<break time="0.5s"/>
said,<break time="0.5s"/>

When the girls told<break time="2s"/> their father about Moses,<break time="2s"/>
he sent them<break time="2s"/> back to the well.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“Tell that nice man to<break time="2s"/> come and eat with us.<break time="2s"/>

Moses came to<break time="2s"/> eat at Jethro’s house.<break time="2s"/>
He slept there,<break time="1s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
Then he stayed at Jethro’s<break time="2s"/> house for a long time.<break time="2s"/>
He took care<break time="2s"/> of Jethro’s sheep.<break time="2s"/>
He was a shepherd.<break time="1.3s"/>

While Moses was taking<break time="2s"/> care of the sheep,<break time="2s"/>
he prayed to God.<break time="1.3s"/>
God was his teacher.<break time="1.3s"/>
He learned to<break time="2s"/> be kind and patient.<break time="2s"/>
He didn’t want to<break time="2s"/> be a soldier any more.<break time="2s"/>

Moses married one<break time="2s"/> of Jethro’s daughters.<break time="2s"/>
Her name was Zipporah.<break time="1.3s"/>
They had two sons.<break time="1.3s"/>
They were happy living<break time="2s"/> in the land of Midian.<break time="2s"/>
