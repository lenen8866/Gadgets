Little streams of water became a flooded river that<break time="2s"/> rushed down the valley and in to the lake.<break time="2s"/>
The house in the valley which had been built<break time="2s"/> so quickly and carelessly fell down and was washed away.<break time="2s"/>
But the stone house<break time="2s"/> on the rock stood firm.<break time="2s"/>

Then Jesus said,<break time="1s"/>
“Everyone who comes to Me,<break time="1.8s"/>
and obeys Me is like the wise<break time="2s"/> man who built his house on the rock.<break time="2s"/>
Even when storms and<break time="2s"/> wind and rain come,<break time="2s"/>
the house is safe.<break time="1.3s"/>

“People who hear what I tell<break time="2s"/> them but do not obey Me,<break time="2s"/>
are like the foolish man who<break time="2s"/> built his house on the sand.<break time="2s"/>
When the storm came,<break time="1.3s"/>
it fell with<break time="2s"/> a terrible crash.<break time="2s"/>
