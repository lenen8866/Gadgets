<break time="0.5s"/>God had given Abraham and Sarah<break time="2s"/> a son when they were old.<break time="2s"/>
How they loved Isaac.<break time="1.3s"/>
What a happy home they had as he grew up to<break time="2s"/> be a man! He was obedient and loved the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
After Sarah died,<break time="1s"/>
Abraham called Eliezer,<break time="1s"/>
his servant,<break time="1s"/>
to him.<break time="1s"/>
“Eliezer,<break time="0.5s"/>
” he said,<break time="1s"/>
“I am getting old and Isaac<break time="2s"/> needs a wife to be with him.<break time="2s"/>
I want you<break time="2s"/> to go to Haran,<break time="2s"/>
where my brother’s family lives,<break time="1.8s"/>
to find a<break time="2s"/> wife for Isaac.<break time="2s"/>
God will send his angel before<break time="2s"/> you to help you find her.<break time="2s"/>
” Eliezer took ten camels with gifts for<break time="2s"/> the girl God would choose and for her family.<break time="2s"/>

The trip took<break time="2s"/> days of travelling.<break time="2s"/>
At last Eliezer got to Haran and stopped<break time="2s"/> to rest his camels at the village well.<break time="2s"/>
It was evening,<break time="1s"/>
and the women were coming<break time="2s"/> to fill their pitchers with water.<break time="2s"/>
Eliezer didn’t know anyone.<break time="1.3s"/>
He started talking to<break time="2s"/> God in his heart.<break time="2s"/>

“Please,<break time="0.5s"/>
God,<break time="0.5s"/>
help me to find<break time="2s"/> the right wife for Isaac.<break time="2s"/>
Let it be that when I ask<break time="2s"/> the right woman to give me a drink,<break time="2s"/>
she will answer,<break time="1s"/>
‘Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
and I’ll give<break time="2s"/> water to your camels,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

While Eliezer was still praying,<break time="1.8s"/>
a lovely young woman<break time="2s"/> came to the well.<break time="2s"/>
She filled her<break time="2s"/> pitcher with water.<break time="2s"/>
Then Eliezer asked<break time="2s"/> her for a drink.<break time="2s"/>
“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
” she said,<break time="1s"/>
“and I’ll give<break time="2s"/> water to your camels,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

“How quickly God has answered<break time="2s"/> my prayer!” Eliezer was thinking.<break time="2s"/>

The young woman said<break time="2s"/> that her name was Rebekah.<break time="2s"/>
She told Eliezer that<break time="2s"/> Abraham’s brother was her grandfather.<break time="2s"/>
“And there is room at<break time="2s"/> our house for you to stay,<break time="2s"/>
” she said.<break time="1s"/>

Everyone in Rebekah’s family was<break time="2s"/> excited to hear all about Abraham,<break time="2s"/>
Sarah,<break time="0.5s"/>
and Isaac.<break time="1s"/>
Eliezer told about why he had come to<break time="2s"/> Haran and about his prayer at the well.<break time="2s"/>
Rebekah’s eyes shone<break time="2s"/> as she listened.<break time="2s"/>

The parents said,<break time="1s"/>
“This is from God.<break time="1.3s"/>
” When they asked Rebekah if<break time="2s"/> she would go to be Isaac’s wife,<break time="2s"/>
she said that she would.<break time="1.8s"/>

Eliezer wanted to begin the<break time="2s"/> trip back to Canaan very soon.<break time="2s"/>
Abraham and Isaac<break time="2s"/> would be waiting.<break time="2s"/>
So everyone was busy helping<break time="2s"/> Rebekah get ready to go.<break time="2s"/>

It was hard for Rebekah<break time="2s"/> to say good-bye to her family,<break time="2s"/>
but she knew God wanted<break time="2s"/> her to be Isaac’s wife.<break time="2s"/>

On the long<break time="2s"/> trip to Isaac’s home,<break time="2s"/>
Rebekah had many<break time="2s"/> questions for Eliezer.<break time="2s"/>
He told her about Abraham<break time="2s"/> and Isaac and their home.<break time="2s"/>

At last they could<break time="2s"/> see Abraham’s tents far away.<break time="2s"/>
Then they saw Isaac<break time="2s"/> coming to meet them.<break time="2s"/>

There was a<break time="2s"/> big wedding feast.<break time="2s"/>
It was a happy<break time="2s"/> day in Abraham’s home.<break time="2s"/>
Isaac loved his<break time="2s"/> beautiful wife very much.<break time="2s"/>
She helped to<break time="2s"/> make him happy.<break time="2s"/>
Abraham was happy too.<break time="1.3s"/>
