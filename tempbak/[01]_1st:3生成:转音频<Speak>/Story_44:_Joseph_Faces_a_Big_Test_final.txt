<break time="0.5s"/>Joseph felt like God was walking beside<break time="2s"/> him as he came nearer to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Ahead he could see big<break time="2s"/> pyramids and green palm trees.<break time="2s"/>

In Egypt Joseph saw<break time="2s"/> many slaves at work.<break time="2s"/>
They were doing hard work.<break time="1.8s"/>
“What job would he have?<break time="2s"/> Who would buy him?” he wondered.<break time="2s"/>

The men and camels<break time="2s"/> came to a city.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph had always lived in<break time="2s"/> a tent in the country.<break time="2s"/>
He had never seen<break time="2s"/> a city like this.<break time="2s"/>
Donkeys pulling carts full<break time="2s"/> of fruit went by.<break time="2s"/>
There were horses pulling chariots.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph looked this<break time="2s"/> way and that,<break time="2s"/>
trying to see<break time="2s"/> everything at once.<break time="2s"/>

Then,<break time="0.5s"/>
in front of him was the slave<break time="2s"/> market where slaves were bought by other people.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was afraid.<break time="1s"/>
But when he prayed,<break time="1.3s"/>
God helped him<break time="2s"/> to be brave.<break time="2s"/>

Potiphar was a man<break time="2s"/> who worked for Pharaoh,<break time="2s"/>
the king.<break time="1s"/>
He came to the<break time="2s"/> slave market that day.<break time="2s"/>
He decided to<break time="2s"/> buy one more slave.<break time="2s"/>
He came and<break time="2s"/> looked at Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph stood straight and tall.<break time="1.8s"/>
Potiphar decided to buy him.<break time="1.8s"/>

The chains were<break time="2s"/> taken off Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
He held his head high<break time="2s"/> as they walked to Potiphar’s chariot.<break time="2s"/>

The horses pulled the<break time="2s"/> chariot through some shiny gates.<break time="2s"/>
They went down a long<break time="2s"/> path to Potiphar’s big house.<break time="2s"/>
There were beautiful flowers and<break time="2s"/> tall palm trees beside the path.<break time="2s"/>
In the gardens were<break time="2s"/> brightly colored birds in cages.<break time="2s"/>

Whatever work Joseph was given<break time="2s"/> to do in his new home,<break time="2s"/>
he did it<break time="2s"/> the best he could.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph thanked God for<break time="2s"/> a nice place to work.<break time="2s"/>
He prayed to<break time="2s"/> God every day.<break time="2s"/>

Potiphar watched Joseph.<break time="1s"/>
He liked the way<break time="2s"/> Joseph did his work.<break time="2s"/>
Soon he gave<break time="2s"/> Joseph a better job.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph worked even harder.<break time="1.3s"/>

Potiphar trusted Joseph<break time="2s"/> more and more.<break time="2s"/>
After awhile he had to<break time="2s"/> take care of everything Potiphar had.<break time="2s"/>
God blessed Potiphar’s house<break time="2s"/> and fields because of Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
Potiphar loved Joseph<break time="2s"/> like his own son.<break time="2s"/>

Then a sad<break time="2s"/> thing happened to Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
Potiphar’s wife told<break time="2s"/> a lie about him.<break time="2s"/>
Potiphar put Joseph in prison.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph had been<break time="2s"/> a faithful worker.<break time="2s"/>
Now he was in prison<break time="2s"/> for something he didn’t do.<break time="2s"/>
Still Joseph trusted<break time="2s"/> God to help him.<break time="2s"/>

He would be the<break time="2s"/> best prisoner he could be.<break time="2s"/>
