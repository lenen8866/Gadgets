<break time="0.5s"/>God had made<break time="2s"/> a beautiful new world.<break time="2s"/>
He had created people to<break time="2s"/> be part of His family.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to love Him.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to be happy.<break time="2s"/>
But as years went by,<break time="1.8s"/>
people were more<break time="2s"/> and more disobedient.<break time="2s"/>
They did not love God.<break time="1.8s"/>
They chose Satan’s ways.<break time="1.3s"/>

God knew they could not be<break time="2s"/> happy if they kept doing wrong things.<break time="2s"/>

There were a few people<break time="2s"/> in the world who loved God.<break time="2s"/>
Maybe these friends<break time="2s"/> could help Him.<break time="2s"/>
They could tell others about<break time="2s"/> how much God loved them.<break time="2s"/>

Noah was one<break time="2s"/> of God’s good friends.<break time="2s"/>
