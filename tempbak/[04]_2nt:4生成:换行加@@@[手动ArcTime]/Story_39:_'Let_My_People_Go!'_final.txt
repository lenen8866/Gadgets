When Moses was on
 his way to Egypt,
he met his brother Aaron.
How happy the brothers were to see each
 other again! There was so much to talk about.
But the most exciting thing was that Moses was
 to lead the Israelite people out of Egypt very soon.
Aaron would help him.
God's people would not
 be slaves any more.
They would live in a
 beautiful land and be free.
Moses and Aaron talked and
 talked as they walked to Egypt.@@@

When they got there,
they went to Goshen
 where the Israelites lived.
They called some of the men
 to have a meeting with them.
They told the men
 what God had said.@@@

Then Moses and Aaron
 went to see Pharaoh.
They told him that God
 wanted the Israelites to leave Egypt.
They told him
 that God had said,
'Let My people go.@@@

Pharaoh was very angry.
He said,
'Who is God? Why should I
 obey Him? I do not know Him.
I will not
 let the people go.@@@

Then Pharaoh told the slave masters to
 make the people work harder than ever.
He would not give them
 straw to make bricks any more.
The slaves had to
 find their own straw.
It was very,
very hard.
The slave masters whipped the Israelites' backs and
 legs when they could not work fast enough.@@@

Some of the people
 went to talk to Pharaoh.
'Our work is too hard,
' they said.
'We canâ€™t make so many
 bricks and find the straw too.@@@

Pharaoh just said,
'You are lazy! We
 will not give you straw.
Go back to work again.@@@

The people talked
 to Moses and Aaron.
'You have made
 us have harder work,
' they said.@@@

Moses was sad.
'Dear God,
' he prayed,
'why did you send me here? The
 people have to work harder than before.@@@

God told Moses to tell the
 people that He would help them.
But first God would show His mighty
 power to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt.
Then they would learn that
 He was the true God.
