<break time="0.5s"/>Jesus told many stories to help<break time="2s"/> people understand how to be God’s children.<break time="2s"/>
One of these stories<break time="2s"/> was about building houses.<break time="2s"/>

Long ago a very wise<break time="2s"/> man decided to build a house.<break time="2s"/>
He searched here and there looking<break time="2s"/> for the best place to build.<break time="2s"/>
At last he<break time="2s"/> found a good place.<break time="2s"/>

“I’ve found the spot on<break time="2s"/> which I shall build my house,<break time="2s"/>
” he told his friend.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Where?” his friend<break time="2s"/> wanted to know.<break time="2s"/>

“On the hill up there.<break time="1.8s"/>
” he pointed.<break time="1s"/>

“Why so far<break time="2s"/> away?” his friend asked.<break time="2s"/>
“Why don’t you build beside me here<break time="2s"/> on the sand? It would be much easier.<break time="2s"/>

The wise man<break time="2s"/> shook his head.<break time="2s"/>
“You see,<break time="1s"/>
I want the house that I build<break time="2s"/> to last as long as I live,<break time="2s"/>
and as long as my<break time="2s"/> children and my grandchildren live.<break time="2s"/>

“You’re in for a<break time="2s"/> lot of hard work,<break time="2s"/>
” his friend said.<break time="1.3s"/>

Up on the hill,<break time="1.3s"/>
the wise man began<break time="2s"/> to build his house.<break time="2s"/>
He worked from morning<break time="2s"/> until night every day.<break time="2s"/>
First he took<break time="2s"/> away the stones.<break time="2s"/>
His back ached.<break time="1s"/>
His arms and<break time="2s"/> hands were sore.<break time="2s"/>
He didn’t mind the pain.<break time="1.8s"/>
“My house must be<break time="2s"/> built on solid rock,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>

Down in the valley his<break time="2s"/> friend was building a house too.<break time="2s"/>
It was easy to dig<break time="2s"/> the foundation in the sand.<break time="2s"/>
He laughed at the man on<break time="2s"/> the hill who was working so hard.<break time="2s"/>

Since the wise man wanted<break time="2s"/> to build the best house possible,<break time="2s"/>
he laid the foundation<break time="2s"/> on the solid rock.<break time="2s"/>
He looked for the<break time="2s"/> best stones he could find.<break time="2s"/>
The strong walls<break time="2s"/> began to rise,<break time="2s"/>
stone upon stone.<break time="1s"/>
At last his<break time="2s"/> house was finished.<break time="2s"/>
It stood on<break time="2s"/> a strong foundation,<break time="2s"/>
firm,<break time="0.5s"/>
straight and beautiful.<break time="1s"/>

The storms came.<break time="1s"/>
Rain poured down.<break time="1s"/>
Little streams of water became a flooded river that<break time="2s"/> rushed down the valley and in to the lake.<break time="2s"/>
The house in the valley which had been built<break time="2s"/> so quickly and carelessly fell down and was washed away.<break time="2s"/>
But the stone house<break time="2s"/> on the rock stood firm.<break time="2s"/>

Then Jesus said,<break time="1s"/>
“Everyone who comes to Me,<break time="1.8s"/>
and obeys Me is like the wise<break time="2s"/> man who built his house on the rock.<break time="2s"/>
Even when storms and<break time="2s"/> wind and rain come,<break time="2s"/>
the house is safe.<break time="1.3s"/>

“People who hear what I tell<break time="2s"/> them but do not obey Me,<break time="2s"/>
are like the foolish man who<break time="2s"/> built his house on the sand.<break time="2s"/>
When the storm came,<break time="1.3s"/>
it fell with<break time="2s"/> a terrible crash.<break time="2s"/>

The story was finished.<break time="1.3s"/>
The people started down<break time="2s"/> the road towards home.<break time="2s"/>
Ever after,<break time="1s"/>
when they looked at houses,<break time="1.8s"/>
they remembered the story<break time="2s"/> of the two houses,<break time="2s"/>
and they understood<break time="2s"/> what Jesus meant.<break time="2s"/>
