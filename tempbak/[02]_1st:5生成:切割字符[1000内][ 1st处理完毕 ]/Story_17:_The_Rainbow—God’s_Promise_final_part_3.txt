Then the family knew that plants<break time="2s"/> were beginning to grow on the earth.<break time="2s"/>
Soon God would<break time="2s"/> open the door.<break time="2s"/>
After another week Noah<break time="2s"/> sent the dove out again.<break time="2s"/>
It did not come back.<break time="1.8s"/>
It had found a<break time="2s"/> resting place and food.<break time="2s"/>

After more time had passed,<break time="1.8s"/>
Noah heard God’s voice.<break time="1.3s"/>
“It is time to<break time="2s"/> come out of the ark,<break time="2s"/>
” He said.<break time="1s"/>
“Bring out your family and<break time="2s"/> all the animals and birds.<break time="2s"/>

God sent His angel<break time="2s"/> to open the door.<break time="2s"/>
Slowly the big<break time="2s"/> door swung open.<break time="2s"/>
