He wanted it where<break time="2s"/> many people could see it.<break time="2s"/>

On the grass Noah marked<break time="2s"/> the size of the boat.<break time="2s"/>
He got men to<break time="2s"/> help him cut down trees.<break time="2s"/>
Then they started to<break time="2s"/> build the big boat.<break time="2s"/>
While they worked he<break time="2s"/> told them about God’s plan.<break time="2s"/>
He told about the<break time="2s"/> ark and the flood.<break time="2s"/>
And he told them<break time="2s"/> about how God loved them.<break time="2s"/>
“If you come<break time="2s"/> into the ark,<break time="2s"/>
you can be safe,<break time="1.3s"/>
” Noah said.<break time="1s"/>
