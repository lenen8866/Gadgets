When all the animals and
 birds were inside the ark,
God said,
“Go into the ark,
Noah.
Take your family in,
too.@@@

Noah felt very sorry for
 the people outside the ark.
“I wish they
 would listen to me,
” he thought sadly.
Then he went inside
 the ark where his wife,
his three sons and
 their wives were waiting.@@@

There was a
 flash of light.
An angel had come from heaven to
 close the heavy door of the ark.
Slowly the door
 began to swing shut.
Then it was closed.
No person could open it.@@@

Seven days went by.
The sun was shining brightly.
In the ark,
Noah and his family
 were waiting for the rain.
They knew it would rain.
Around the ark the
 people were having a party.
They ate and drank.
They made fun of
 Noah and the boat.
“There is no God,
” they said.@@@

Then dark clouds began
 to cover the sun.
Thunder shook the earth.
Rain began to fall.
It rained harder and harder.
Big fountains of water came from the
 ground and threw rocks into the air.
Rivers flooded the earth.@@@

At last people believed
 what Noah had told them.
Some banged on
 the ark door.
But Noah could
 not open the door.
It was too late to
 choose God and go in.
