<break time="0.5s"/>It could be seen<break time="2s"/> on the fourth day.<break time="2s"/>
It is really a sun.<break time="1.8s"/>
It is very far away.<break time="1.8s"/>
You cannot see<break time="2s"/> it in the daytime.<break time="2s"/>
You can see<break time="2s"/> it in the night.<break time="2s"/>
There are so many of<break time="2s"/> them you cannot count them.<break time="2s"/>

The beautiful plants that<break time="2s"/> God had created needed sunshine.<break time="2s"/>
So on the<break time="2s"/> fourth day God said,<break time="2s"/>
"Let there be<break time="2s"/> lights in the sky.<break time="2s"/>
" The clouds moved away<break time="2s"/> and there was the sun,<break time="2s"/>
a very big<break time="2s"/> ball of fire.<break time="2s"/>
For the first time the<break time="2s"/> warm sunlight shone on the earth.<break time="2s"/>
It touched the plants.<break time="1.3s"/>
They began to grow.<break time="1.3s"/>
The sunshine made<break time="2s"/> everything pretty and warm.<break time="2s"/>

For the darkness of night God<break time="2s"/> created the stars and the moon.<break time="2s"/>
These give us<break time="2s"/> light at night.<break time="2s"/>
They help make<break time="2s"/> the night sky beautiful.<break time="2s"/>
They help us to<break time="2s"/> know the months and seasons,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

Evening came.<break time="1s"/>
The fourth day was done.<break time="1.8s"/>
God saw that His<break time="2s"/> work was very good.<break time="2s"/>

Color each space in<break time="2s"/> the puzzle blue or yellow.<break time="2s"/>
Where there is<break time="2s"/> a "B" color blue.<break time="2s"/>
Where there is<break time="2s"/> a "Y" color yellow.<break time="2s"/>
Then you will<break time="2s"/> know what it is.<break time="2s"/>
