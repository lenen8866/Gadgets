“Could it be Joseph’s coat?<break time="2s"/> It looks something like it.<break time="2s"/>

“It is my son’s<break time="2s"/> coat!” Jacob cried out.<break time="2s"/>
“It is the<break time="2s"/> one I gave him.<break time="2s"/>
A wild animal<break time="2s"/> has killed him.<break time="2s"/>

Poor Jacob! For days<break time="2s"/> and weeks he was sad.<break time="2s"/>
His sons and daughter<break time="2s"/> tried to comfort him,<break time="2s"/>
but they could not.<break time="1.3s"/>
His dear son,<break time="1s"/>
Joseph,<break time="0.5s"/>

The brothers felt sorry when they<break time="2s"/> saw how sad their father was.<break time="2s"/>
But they did not tell<break time="2s"/> anyone what they had done.<break time="2s"/>
They thought their<break time="2s"/> father would never know.<break time="2s"/>
But they had<break time="2s"/> forgotten one thing.<break time="2s"/>
They had forgotten God.<break time="1.3s"/>
