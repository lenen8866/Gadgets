Fire! Red and yellow flames! What could be
 burning? “Are all the sheep safe?” Moses wondered.
He looked at
 the fire again.
Bright flames were coming from
 the middle of a thorn bush.
But the bush
 was green and pretty.
“How can that
 be?” Moses asked.
He walked very
 slowly—closer to the bush.@@@

“Moses! Moses!” a voice called.
“Yes,
I am here,
” Moses answered.@@@

“Don’t come near.
Take off your shoes.
You are standing
 on holy ground.
I am the
 God of Abraham,
Isaac,
and Jacob.
” Moses quickly
 took off his shoes.
He covered his
 face in reverence.@@@

God spoke again.
“I have seen the troubles
 of the Israelite people in Egypt.
I have heard their prayers.
I will bring my people out
 of Egypt to a good land.
Moses,
I have chosen you to
 lead the people out of Egypt.
Go to the new Pharaoh and
 tell him to let My people go.@@@

“Who am I?”
 Moses asked God.
“I am only
 a poor shepherd.
I am not the
 one to help the people.@@@

“Don’t be afraid,
” God said.
“I will be with you.@@@

“I forgot how to
 speak the language of Egypt,
” Moses said.@@@

“I will be with your mouth
 and teach you what to say,
” God said.
“Your brother,
Aaron,
is on his
 way to meet you.
He will help you.@@@

Moses obeyed God.
He took the sheep home.
Then he got
 ready for the trip.
He said good-bye to his family
 and started on his way to Egypt.
