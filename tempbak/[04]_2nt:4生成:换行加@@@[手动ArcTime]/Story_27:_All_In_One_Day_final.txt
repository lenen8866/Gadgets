It was very
 early in the morning.
Pharaoh,
the king of Egypt,
could not sleep.
He kept thinking of the
 dreams he had just had.
What strange dreams! What could
 they mean? He couldn’t sleep.
Better get up.
He would call his
 wise men to the palace.
They would tell him
 what these dreams meant.@@@

“Bring all my wise men,
” he told his servants.
Horses galloped through the streets bringing
 these important men to the palace.@@@

Soon Pharaoh was
 in his throne room.
His sleepy wise
 men were there.
They were all
 looking at Pharaoh.
They were thinking,@@@

Pharaoh said,
“I had two
 very strange dreams.
I cannot rest until
 I know what they mean.
In my first dream I
 was standing by the Nile River.
I saw seven cows
 come out of the river.
They were nice fat cows.@@@

“Then seven more
 cows came out.
There have never been such
 ugly cows in all Egypt.
They were so skinny that all
 their bones seemed to be sticking out.@@@

“Then a very
 strange thing happened.
The skinny cows ate
 up the fat cows.
But they were still skinny.@@@

“Then I had another dream.
I saw seven heads
 of grain on one stem.
The kernels of
 grain looked very good.
There were seven more heads
 of grain on the same stem.
These did not look good
 and had little dried-up kernels.
The poor-looking heads ate
 up the good ones.
They didn’t look any better.
Then I woke up.
I have called you here to
 tell me what my dreams mean.@@@

The room was very quiet.
No one said anything.
Pharaoh waited.
Some of the king’s helpers tried
 to act as if they were thinking.
“Tell me!” shouted Pharaoh.
“Someone tell me what the
 dreams mean!” No one said anything.@@@

“Please tell me
 what my dreams mean.
Is it good or
 bad?” Pharaoh asked again.
No one answered.@@@

The butler came to
 bring Pharaoh a drink.
When he heard
 about the king’s dreams,@@@

He bowed low
 before the king.
Then he told about
 his dream in the prison.
He told about
 the baker’s dream too.
And he told about Joseph.
“There was a
 slave in the prison,
” he said.
“He told us
 what our dreams meant,
and it all came true.@@@

Pharaoh stood up.
“Find that prisoner.
