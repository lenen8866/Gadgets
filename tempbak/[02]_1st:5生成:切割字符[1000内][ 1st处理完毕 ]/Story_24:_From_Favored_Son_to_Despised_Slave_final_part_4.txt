Joseph could see the<break time="2s"/> place where his home was.<break time="2s"/>
Over there,<break time="1s"/>
not so far away,<break time="1.3s"/>
his father was waiting.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was waiting for<break time="2s"/> Joseph to come home.<break time="2s"/>
How sad Jacob would be when he<break time="2s"/> found that Joseph was not coming home.<break time="2s"/>

The trip was hard<break time="2s"/> and long for Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
For nearly twelve days the men with the<break time="2s"/> camels and slaves travelled over the hot desert sands.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was very<break time="2s"/> tired and hot.<break time="2s"/>

He thought about the things he<break time="2s"/> had planned to do for God.<break time="2s"/>
Now he would<break time="2s"/> be a slave.<break time="2s"/>
He thought of his dreams.<break time="1.8s"/>
“I’m sure God<break time="2s"/> gave them to me,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
