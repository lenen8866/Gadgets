The sun was
 setting in the west.
The sixth day was over
 and the seventh day was beginning.
God was finished
 making this world.
It was time
 for a big celebration.
The angel choir sang
 beautiful music to praise God.@@@

God rested on
 the seventh day.
He blessed the day
 and made it special.
He called it the Sabbath.
It was always to
 be a rest day.
It was to be a day to
 enjoy all the things that God had made.
It was a
 day to worship God,
the Creator.@@@

God came down to the Garden of Eden
 to spend the first Sabbath with Adam and Eve.
They walked in
 the garden together.
Adam and Eve asked God questions
 about the things He had created.
They looked at the
 beautiful trees and flowers.
They listened to
 the singing birds.
What a happy day the
 first Sabbath was! God was happy,
too.@@@

God wants us to remember
 the special day He created.
He wants us
 to enjoy every Sabbath.
