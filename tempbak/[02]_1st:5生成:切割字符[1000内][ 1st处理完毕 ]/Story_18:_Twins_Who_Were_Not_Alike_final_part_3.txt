He came right to Jacob’s<break time="2s"/> tent where the food was cooking.<break time="2s"/>
“I’m very hungry,<break time="1s"/>
” he told his brother,<break time="1.8s"/>
“Please give me<break time="2s"/> some of your food.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob got an idea.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
” he said<break time="2s"/> to his brother.<break time="2s"/>
“Give me your birthright and you<break time="2s"/> can have all the food you want.<break time="2s"/>
” Right then,<break time="1s"/>
Esau cared more about getting<break time="2s"/> food than having the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
So he said yes.<break time="1.3s"/>
Jacob gave him the food.<break time="1.8s"/>

Many years passed by before<break time="2s"/> Esau remembered about the birthright again.<break time="2s"/>
He did not<break time="2s"/> care about God,<break time="2s"/>
but Jacob loved<break time="2s"/> the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
