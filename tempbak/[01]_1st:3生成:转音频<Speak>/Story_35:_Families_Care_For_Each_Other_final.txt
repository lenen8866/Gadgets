<break time="0.5s"/>“What a nice<break time="2s"/> baby!” the princess said.<break time="2s"/>
She picked Moses up<break time="2s"/> and wiped away his tears.<break time="2s"/>
“You must be one<break time="2s"/> of the Israelite babies,<break time="2s"/>
” she said.<break time="1s"/>

“The princess loves our baby,<break time="1.8s"/>
too,<break time="0.5s"/>
” Miriam thought as she<break time="2s"/> watched the princess hug the baby.<break time="2s"/>

“What are you going to do<break time="2s"/> with him?” one of the maids asked.<break time="2s"/>

“I’m going to keep him,<break time="1.8s"/>
” said the princess.<break time="1.3s"/>
“No one is going<break time="2s"/> to hurt this child.<break time="2s"/>

“Her father is King Pharaoh,<break time="1.8s"/>
” Miriam thought.<break time="1s"/>
“He won’t like this baby.<break time="1.8s"/>

Right then Miriam<break time="2s"/> knew what to do.<break time="2s"/>
God was helping her.<break time="1.3s"/>
She came out<break time="2s"/> from her hiding place.<break time="2s"/>
Her heart was<break time="2s"/> beating very fast.<break time="2s"/>
She was afraid,<break time="1s"/>
but she walked right up<break time="2s"/> to the princess and bowed.<break time="2s"/>

“Do you want me to go and find one of the<break time="2s"/> Israelite women to take care of the baby for you?” she asked.<break time="2s"/>
The princess looked at Miriam.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Go,<break time="0.5s"/>
” she said to Miriam.<break time="1.8s"/>
Miriam didn’t know that<break time="2s"/> she could run so fast.<break time="2s"/>
In a short time<break time="2s"/> Mother stood before the princess.<break time="2s"/>
She had run fast,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

“Take this baby home and<break time="2s"/> take care of him for me,<break time="2s"/>
” the princess said.<break time="1.3s"/>
“I will pay<break time="2s"/> you for it.<break time="2s"/>
” Then she smiled at Jochabed and<break time="2s"/> put Moses into his very own Mother’s arms.<break time="2s"/>
