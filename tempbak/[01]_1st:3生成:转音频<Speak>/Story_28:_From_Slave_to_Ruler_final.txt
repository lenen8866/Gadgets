<break time="0.5s"/>“Pharaoh wants to see<break time="2s"/> me?” Joseph was surprised.<break time="2s"/>
But when the king calls,<break time="1.8s"/>
you obey! Joseph shaved and dressed in<break time="2s"/> the clean clothes they brought to him.<break time="2s"/>
He combed his hair nicely.<break time="1.8s"/>
There was a<break time="2s"/> prayer in his heart.<break time="2s"/>
He was ready.<break time="1s"/>

Joseph followed the king’s servant<break time="2s"/> through the long palace halls.<break time="2s"/>
At last he stood before<break time="2s"/> Pharaoh seated on his beautiful throne.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph knew how to act and<break time="2s"/> what to do in a palace.<break time="2s"/>
He had learned these things<break time="2s"/> when he worked for Potiphar.<break time="2s"/>
He kneeled before the king.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then he stood up<break time="2s"/> tall in front of him.<break time="2s"/>

“I had some<break time="2s"/> very strange dreams,<break time="2s"/>
” Pharaoh told Joseph.<break time="1.3s"/>
“No one can tell<break time="2s"/> me what they mean.<break time="2s"/>

“I cannot tell you,<break time="1.3s"/>
” Joseph said,<break time="1s"/>
“but my God,<break time="1s"/>
the God of heaven,<break time="1.3s"/>
can give Pharaoh the<break time="2s"/> meaning of his dreams.<break time="2s"/>

After Pharaoh told<break time="2s"/> Joseph his dreams,<break time="2s"/>
God helped Joseph to<break time="2s"/> know what they meant.<break time="2s"/>

“Both dreams mean<break time="2s"/> the same thing,<break time="2s"/>
” Joseph said.<break time="1s"/>
“The seven fat cows and the seven good ears of<break time="2s"/> grain mean that there will be seven good years in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
There will be enough rain<break time="2s"/> and everything will grow well.<break time="2s"/>

“The seven skinny cows and the seven poor<break time="2s"/> ears of corn mean that after the good years,<break time="2s"/>
seven very bad<break time="2s"/> years will come.<break time="2s"/>
No rain will fall.<break time="1.3s"/>
Nothing will grow.<break time="1s"/>
There will be a famine.<break time="1.8s"/>

Pharaoh was afraid.<break time="1s"/>
Seven years of famine in Egypt? No food<break time="2s"/> could grow! All the people and animals would die.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph wanted to<break time="2s"/> help the king.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
king,<break time="0.5s"/>
I think you should choose<break time="2s"/> a wise man in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He should start<break time="2s"/> working right away.<break time="2s"/>
He should build big storehouses to put<break time="2s"/> a lot of food for the bad years.<break time="2s"/>
Then when that time comes<break time="2s"/> there will be food for all.<break time="2s"/>

Pharaoh felt better now.<break time="1.3s"/>
This young man<break time="2s"/> knew what to do.<break time="2s"/>
The king and his helpers chose Joseph<break time="2s"/> to be the one to store up food.<break time="2s"/>

“No one is<break time="2s"/> wiser than you.<break time="2s"/>
I am making you<break time="2s"/> the governor of Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
” the king told Joseph.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Only I,<break time="1s"/>
Pharaoh,<break time="0.5s"/>
will be higher than you.<break time="1.8s"/>
You will be the one to keep the<break time="2s"/> people of Egypt from starving when the famine comes.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph couldn’t believe it.<break time="1.3s"/>
Had he heard Pharaoh right? He<break time="2s"/> was not a slave any more.<break time="2s"/>
He did not have<break time="2s"/> to go back to prison.<break time="2s"/>
He was next to the king<break time="2s"/> in power! He was governor of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>

All in one day it had<break time="2s"/> happened! In the morning Joseph woke up.<break time="2s"/>
It seemed like it was going<break time="2s"/> to be just another day in prison.<break time="2s"/>
That night he was in a<break time="2s"/> beautiful room in the king’s palace.<break time="2s"/>
He stood by his window<break time="2s"/> looking out on the lovely gardens.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph did not forget to<break time="2s"/> thank God for His loving care.<break time="2s"/>
