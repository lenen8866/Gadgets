but no one<break time="2s"/> was very happy.<break time="2s"/>
They wondered what would happen<break time="2s"/> when this food was gone.<break time="2s"/>

That time came soon.<break time="1.3s"/>
Jacob told his sons to<break time="2s"/> go back to Egypt for food.<break time="2s"/>
Judah said,<break time="1s"/>
“The man will not even let us<break time="2s"/> see him if we don’t bring Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>
We will not go<break time="2s"/> unless Benjamin is with us.<break time="2s"/>
” Finally Jacob said<break time="2s"/> they could take Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>
“And take the<break time="2s"/> money with you.<break time="2s"/>
We will send some<break time="2s"/> gifts to the governor too.<break time="2s"/>

When the brothers<break time="2s"/> got to Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
they went right to the<break time="2s"/> governor and bowed down before him.<break time="2s"/>
