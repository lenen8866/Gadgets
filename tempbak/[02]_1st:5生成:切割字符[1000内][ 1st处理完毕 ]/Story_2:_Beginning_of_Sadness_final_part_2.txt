Then Lucifer started to<break time="2s"/> talk to the other angels.<break time="2s"/>
"God is not fair,<break time="1.3s"/>
" he said.<break time="1s"/>
"He likes the<break time="2s"/> Son better than me.<break time="2s"/>
" The angels were surprised.<break time="1.8s"/>
They loved God.<break time="1s"/>
But slowly,<break time="1s"/>
some of the<break time="2s"/> angels believed Lucifer.<break time="2s"/>

God the Father and<break time="2s"/> the Son talked with Lucifer.<break time="2s"/>
They tried to help him.<break time="1.8s"/>
But Lucifer wanted<break time="2s"/> to be like God.<break time="2s"/>
A being God had made<break time="2s"/> could not be like Him.<break time="2s"/>

At last,<break time="1s"/>
God had to send<break time="2s"/> Lucifer out of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
Many of the<break time="2s"/> angels went with him.<break time="2s"/>
It was a very<break time="2s"/> sad time in heaven.<break time="2s"/>
