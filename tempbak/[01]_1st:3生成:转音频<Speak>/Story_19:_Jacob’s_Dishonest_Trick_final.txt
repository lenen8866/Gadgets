<break time="0.5s"/>As Isaac grew older,<break time="1.3s"/>
he got blind.<break time="1s"/>
He stayed in his<break time="2s"/> tent most of the time.<break time="2s"/>
One day he decided that it was time<break time="2s"/> to give the birthright blessing to his first-born son.<break time="2s"/>

Isaac called Esau to him.<break time="1.8s"/>
“My son,<break time="1s"/>
” he said,<break time="1s"/>
“Go out hunting and get some deer<break time="2s"/> meat to make me my favorite food.<break time="2s"/>
Then I will give you<break time="2s"/> the birthright blessing before I die.<break time="2s"/>

Rebekah heard what Isaac said.<break time="1.8s"/>
“This must never happen,<break time="1.3s"/>
” she said.<break time="1s"/>
“I’m sure it is Jacob who<break time="2s"/> is supposed to have the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
The angel who talked to me<break time="2s"/> said that Esau would serve Jacob.<break time="2s"/>
” She told Jacob<break time="2s"/> about his father’s plan.<break time="2s"/>

“Go choose two little goats,<break time="1.8s"/>
” she said.<break time="1s"/>
“Bring them to me.<break time="1.3s"/>
I will cook them<break time="2s"/> and make Isaac’s favorite food.<break time="2s"/>
Then you can take<break time="2s"/> the food to him.<break time="2s"/>
He will eat<break time="2s"/> it and bless you.<break time="2s"/>

“But,<break time="0.5s"/>
Mother,<break time="0.5s"/>
” said Jacob,<break time="1s"/>
“I can’t fool Father.<break time="1.3s"/>
Esau is a<break time="2s"/> very hairy man,<break time="2s"/>
and my skin is smooth.<break time="1.8s"/>
Father will know<break time="2s"/> who I am.<break time="2s"/>

“Do not worry,<break time="1s"/>
” Rebekah said,<break time="1s"/>
“for I have a plan.<break time="1.8s"/>
” She cooked<break time="2s"/> the food for Isaac.<break time="2s"/>
Then she gave Jacob some<break time="2s"/> of Esau’s clothes to put on.<break time="2s"/>
Rebekah took some skins from<break time="2s"/> the little goats Jacob had brought.<break time="2s"/>
She put them on Jacob’s<break time="2s"/> arms and around his neck.<break time="2s"/>
Then she sent him with<break time="2s"/> the food to his father’s tent.<break time="2s"/>

“Here I am,<break time="1s"/>
Father,<break time="0.5s"/>
” Jacob said,<break time="1s"/>
trying to talk like Esau.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Which son are<break time="2s"/> you?” Isaac asked.<break time="2s"/>

“I am Esau,<break time="1s"/>
” Jacob lied.<break time="1s"/>
“Here is your favorite<break time="2s"/> food you asked for.<break time="2s"/>
Sit up and eat it.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then bless me.<break time="1s"/>

“How come you found the<break time="2s"/> deer so fast?” Isaac asked.<break time="2s"/>

“God helped me<break time="2s"/> to find it fast,<break time="2s"/>
” Jacob said.<break time="1s"/>

“Come here,<break time="1s"/>
let me feel you.<break time="1.3s"/>
I want to be<break time="2s"/> sure you are Esau.<break time="2s"/>
” Jacob came nearer,<break time="1.3s"/>
and Isaac felt<break time="2s"/> his hands and neck.<break time="2s"/>
“The voice sounds like Jacob,<break time="1.8s"/>
but you feel like Esau.<break time="1.8s"/>

Jacob said,<break time="1s"/>
“I am.<break time="1s"/>

Then Isaac said,<break time="1s"/>
“Bring me the food.<break time="1.3s"/>
I will eat it and<break time="2s"/> then I will bless you.<break time="2s"/>

After Isaac had eaten,<break time="1.3s"/>
he said,<break time="1s"/>
“Come near and give<break time="2s"/> me the blessing kiss.<break time="2s"/>
” After Jacob kissed him,<break time="1.8s"/>
the Spirit of God gave Isaac words<break time="2s"/> to speak that could never be changed.<break time="2s"/>
After Isaac had finished,<break time="1.3s"/>
Jacob left the tent.<break time="1.3s"/>

A little later,<break time="1s"/>
Esau came into<break time="2s"/> Isaac’s tent with food.<break time="2s"/>
“Here I am,<break time="1s"/>
Father,<break time="0.5s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“I have your favorite food.<break time="1.8s"/>
Eat it now<break time="2s"/> and bless me.<break time="2s"/>

“Who are you?”<break time="2s"/> Isaac cried out.<break time="2s"/>

“Why,<break time="0.5s"/>
Father,<break time="0.5s"/>
I am your son Esau.<break time="1.8s"/>

Esau had not<break time="2s"/> cared about the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
Years ago he had agreed to give<break time="2s"/> it to Jacob for a pot of food.<break time="2s"/>
But now he<break time="2s"/> wanted it very much.<break time="2s"/>

“Please bless me,<break time="1s"/>
Father! Bless me,<break time="1s"/>
too!” Esau cried.<break time="1s"/>

Isaac reached out<break time="2s"/> to Esau and said,<break time="2s"/>
“There’s not much<break time="2s"/> to give you.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob has been<break time="2s"/> given the blessing.<break time="2s"/>
But I will give<break time="2s"/> you a smaller blessing.<break time="2s"/>
” Then Isaac blessed Esau.<break time="1.8s"/>
