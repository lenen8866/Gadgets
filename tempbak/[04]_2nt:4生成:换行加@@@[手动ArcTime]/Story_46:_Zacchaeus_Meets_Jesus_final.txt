Mr.
and Mrs.
Zacchaeus and their children lived in one of
 the most beautiful houses in the city of Jericho.
Zacchaeus was rich but
 he was not happy.@@@

He was a tax collector
 for the Roman rulers in Jericho.
He was a short man,
but his job made
 him feel big and important.@@@

For years he had made the
 people pay too much money for taxes.
He kept the
 extra money for himself.
Most tax collectors did that.
Some of the poor people had hardly
 enough money left to buy food and clothes.
Zacchaeus got richer and richer,
but money did
 not make him happy.
The people hated him.
“Liar! Cheat!” they called him.@@@

Zacchaeus knew what the Bible
 says about stealing and cheating.
He knew what the Bible
 says about helping poor people,
too.
He wanted to
 change his ways but,
he didn’t know how.
When he tried to
 go to the synagogue,
the priests wouldn’t let
 him in the door.
“Go away!” they said.
“You are too great a
 sinner to come to church.@@@

Then one day a
 man told him about Jesus,
the great teacher.
“He has twelve disciples,
” this man said.
“One of them
 was a tax collector.@@@

When Zacchaeus heard that,
he thought,
“Jesus has a tax collector for a
 special friend! Maybe there is hope for me.@@@

At once he began making things
 right with people whom he had cheated.
He gave food and clothing
 and gifts to poor people.
For the first time in his
 life he began to feel happy.@@@

One day Zacchaeus looked up from the
 money he was counting in his tax booth.
He saw a crowd of
 people coming down the street.
“What’s all the
 excitement?” he called.@@@

“Jesus is passing
 through our city,
” someone shouted back.@@@

“Jesus,
the Teacher,@@@

Quickly Zacchaeus closed his booth.
He ran to the crowd.
“Why am I
 so short?” he said.
“I wish I were taller.
” Even standing on tiptoes,
he could not see Jesus.
“I must see
 the Teacher!” Zacchaeus shouted.
When people saw it
 was the tax collector,
they stood closer
 together than ever.
“Let me through,
please,
” he begged.
No one listened to him.@@@

The crowd moved
 slowly down the street.
Zacchaeus was not
 going to give up.
Farther down the street he
 saw a big sycamore tree.
He ran ahead of
 the crowd to the tree.
He climbed out on a branch that hung
 over the place where Jesus would soon walk.@@@

Just a few more steps
 and Jesus would pass by.
Suddenly Jesus stopped.
He looked right
 up into Zacchaeus’ face,
and called,
“Zacchaeus,
come down! Hurry! I would like
 to visit you in your house today.
” Shaking with excitement,
Zacchaeus came down
 out of the tree.
He led the
 way toward his house.@@@

He told Jesus,
“Sir,
from now on I will give
 half of my money to the poor.
And to anyone
 I have cheated,
I will give back four times
 as much as I have taken.@@@

Zacchaeus was filled with
 joy when Jesus said,
“Today salvation has
 come to your house.
” He knew
 his sins were forgiven.@@@

Zacchaeus and Jesus had a
 wonderful time together that day.
