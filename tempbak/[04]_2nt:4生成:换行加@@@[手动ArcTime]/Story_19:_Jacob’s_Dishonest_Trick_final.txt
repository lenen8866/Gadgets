As Isaac grew older,
he got blind.
He stayed in his
 tent most of the time.
One day he decided that it was time
 to give the birthright blessing to his first-born son.@@@

Isaac called Esau to him.
“My son,
” he said,
“Go out hunting and get some deer
 meat to make me my favorite food.
Then I will give you
 the birthright blessing before I die.@@@

Rebekah heard what Isaac said.
“This must never happen,
” she said.
“I’m sure it is Jacob who
 is supposed to have the birthright.
The angel who talked to me
 said that Esau would serve Jacob.
” She told Jacob
 about his father’s plan.@@@

“Go choose two little goats,
” she said.
“Bring them to me.
I will cook them
 and make Isaac’s favorite food.
Then you can take
 the food to him.
He will eat
 it and bless you.@@@

“But,
Mother,
” said Jacob,
“I can’t fool Father.
Esau is a
 very hairy man,
and my skin is smooth.
Father will know
 who I am.@@@

“Do not worry,
” Rebekah said,
“for I have a plan.
” She cooked
 the food for Isaac.
Then she gave Jacob some
 of Esau’s clothes to put on.
Rebekah took some skins from
 the little goats Jacob had brought.
She put them on Jacob’s
 arms and around his neck.
Then she sent him with
 the food to his father’s tent.@@@

“Here I am,
Father,
” Jacob said,
trying to talk like Esau.@@@

“Which son are
 you?” Isaac asked.@@@

“I am Esau,
” Jacob lied.
“Here is your favorite
 food you asked for.
Sit up and eat it.
Then bless me.@@@

“How come you found the
 deer so fast?” Isaac asked.@@@

“God helped me
 to find it fast,
” Jacob said.@@@

“Come here,
let me feel you.
I want to be
 sure you are Esau.
” Jacob came nearer,
and Isaac felt
 his hands and neck.
“The voice sounds like Jacob,
but you feel like Esau.@@@

Jacob said,
“I am.@@@

Then Isaac said,
“Bring me the food.
I will eat it and
 then I will bless you.@@@

After Isaac had eaten,
he said,
“Come near and give
 me the blessing kiss.
” After Jacob kissed him,
the Spirit of God gave Isaac words
 to speak that could never be changed.
After Isaac had finished,
Jacob left the tent.@@@

A little later,
Esau came into
 Isaac’s tent with food.
“Here I am,
Father,
” he said.
“I have your favorite food.
Eat it now
 and bless me.@@@

“Who are you?”
 Isaac cried out.@@@

“Why,
Father,
I am your son Esau.@@@

Esau had not
 cared about the birthright.
Years ago he had agreed to give
 it to Jacob for a pot of food.
But now he
 wanted it very much.@@@

“Please bless me,
Father! Bless me,
too!” Esau cried.@@@

Isaac reached out
 to Esau and said,
“There’s not much
 to give you.
Jacob has been
 given the blessing.
But I will give
 you a smaller blessing.
” Then Isaac blessed Esau.
