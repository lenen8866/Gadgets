Joseph felt like God was walking beside
 him as he came nearer to Egypt.
Ahead he could see big
 pyramids and green palm trees.@@@

In Egypt Joseph saw
 many slaves at work.
They were doing hard work.
“What job would he have?
 Who would buy him?” he wondered.@@@

The men and camels
 came to a city.
Joseph had always lived in
 a tent in the country.
He had never seen
 a city like this.
Donkeys pulling carts full
 of fruit went by.
There were horses pulling chariots.
Joseph looked this
 way and that,
trying to see
 everything at once.@@@

Then,
in front of him was the slave
 market where slaves were bought by other people.
Joseph was afraid.
But when he prayed,
God helped him
 to be brave.@@@

Potiphar was a man
 who worked for Pharaoh,
the king.
He came to the
 slave market that day.
He decided to
 buy one more slave.
He came and
 looked at Joseph.
Joseph stood straight and tall.
Potiphar decided to buy him.@@@

The chains were
 taken off Joseph.
He held his head high
 as they walked to Potiphar’s chariot.@@@

The horses pulled the
 chariot through some shiny gates.
They went down a long
 path to Potiphar’s big house.
There were beautiful flowers and
 tall palm trees beside the path.
In the gardens were
 brightly colored birds in cages.@@@

Whatever work Joseph was given
 to do in his new home,
he did it
 the best he could.@@@

Joseph thanked God for
 a nice place to work.
He prayed to
 God every day.@@@

Potiphar watched Joseph.
He liked the way
 Joseph did his work.
Soon he gave
 Joseph a better job.
Joseph worked even harder.@@@

Potiphar trusted Joseph
 more and more.
After awhile he had to
 take care of everything Potiphar had.
God blessed Potiphar’s house
 and fields because of Joseph.
Potiphar loved Joseph
 like his own son.@@@

Then a sad
 thing happened to Joseph.
Potiphar’s wife told
 a lie about him.
Potiphar put Joseph in prison.
Joseph had been
 a faithful worker.
Now he was in prison
 for something he didn’t do.
Still Joseph trusted
 God to help him.@@@

He would be the
 best prisoner he could be.
