“The seven skinny cows and the seven poor<break time="2s"/> ears of corn mean that after the good years,<break time="2s"/>
seven very bad<break time="2s"/> years will come.<break time="2s"/>
No rain will fall.<break time="1.3s"/>
Nothing will grow.<break time="1s"/>
There will be a famine.<break time="1.8s"/>

Pharaoh was afraid.<break time="1s"/>
Seven years of famine in Egypt? No food<break time="2s"/> could grow! All the people and animals would die.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph wanted to<break time="2s"/> help the king.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
king,<break time="0.5s"/>
I think you should choose<break time="2s"/> a wise man in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He should start<break time="2s"/> working right away.<break time="2s"/>
He should build big storehouses to put<break time="2s"/> a lot of food for the bad years.<break time="2s"/>
