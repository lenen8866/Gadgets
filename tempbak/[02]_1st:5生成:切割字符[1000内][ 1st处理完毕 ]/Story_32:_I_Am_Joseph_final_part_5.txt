Jacob could not believe that<break time="2s"/> his son Joseph was still alive.<break time="2s"/>

“It is true,<break time="1s"/>
Father.<break time="0.5s"/>
See all the wagons<break time="2s"/> Joseph sent from Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He wants you to<break time="2s"/> have a good trip.<break time="2s"/>
Look at all the<break time="2s"/> presents he sent you.<break time="2s"/>

At last Jacob believed that his son was<break time="2s"/> really alive! He couldn’t wait to see him again.<break time="2s"/>

And so the happy day came<break time="2s"/> when Jacob and his much loved son,<break time="2s"/>
Joseph,<break time="0.5s"/>
were together again.<break time="1s"/>
When Jacob saw Joseph,<break time="1.3s"/>
he said,<break time="1s"/>
“I have seen you.<break time="1.3s"/>
You are still alive.<break time="1.3s"/>
Now I am<break time="2s"/> ready to die.<break time="2s"/>
” But Jacob<break time="2s"/> did not die.<break time="2s"/>
