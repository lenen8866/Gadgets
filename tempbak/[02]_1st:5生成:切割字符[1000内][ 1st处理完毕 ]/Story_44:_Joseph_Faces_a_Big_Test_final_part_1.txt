<break time="0.5s"/>Joseph felt like God was walking beside<break time="2s"/> him as he came nearer to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Ahead he could see big<break time="2s"/> pyramids and green palm trees.<break time="2s"/>

In Egypt Joseph saw<break time="2s"/> many slaves at work.<break time="2s"/>
They were doing hard work.<break time="1.8s"/>
“What job would he have?<break time="2s"/> Who would buy him?” he wondered.<break time="2s"/>

The men and camels<break time="2s"/> came to a city.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph had always lived in<break time="2s"/> a tent in the country.<break time="2s"/>
He had never seen<break time="2s"/> a city like this.<break time="2s"/>
Donkeys pulling carts full<break time="2s"/> of fruit went by.<break time="2s"/>
There were horses pulling chariots.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph looked this<break time="2s"/> way and that,<break time="2s"/>
trying to see<break time="2s"/> everything at once.<break time="2s"/>
