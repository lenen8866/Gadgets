<break time="0.5s"/>Joseph’s brothers watched until they couldn’t<break time="2s"/> see the caravan of camels any more.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was gone.<break time="1s"/>
Only his beautiful<break time="2s"/> coat was left.<break time="2s"/>
They didn’t care if Joseph was sad or if<break time="2s"/> he would have to work hard as a slave.<break time="2s"/>

Reuben was away<break time="2s"/> when they sold Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
When he came back,<break time="1.3s"/>
he went to the well.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph was not there.<break time="1.3s"/>
Reuben came running<break time="2s"/> to the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
“The child is gone! How can I<break time="2s"/> tell Father? What shall I do?” he cried.<break time="2s"/>

“Joseph is still alive,<break time="1.3s"/>
” the brothers said.<break time="1.3s"/>
“We sold him<break time="2s"/> as a slave.<break time="2s"/>
It will be good for<break time="2s"/> him to learn to work.<break time="2s"/>
” They laughed as<break time="2s"/> they talked about Joseph’s dreams.<break time="2s"/>

Reuben was unhappy.<break time="1s"/>
Father had put him in<break time="2s"/> charge as he was the oldest.<break time="2s"/>
He had planned to<break time="2s"/> take Joseph from the well,<break time="2s"/>
but now his<break time="2s"/> plans could not work.<break time="2s"/>
He could not think of<break time="2s"/> a way to rescue Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
They would have to tell lies to their father so<break time="2s"/> he would not know what they had done to Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers tried to think of<break time="2s"/> what they would tell their father.<break time="2s"/>
He must not know<break time="2s"/> that they had sold Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

First,<break time="0.5s"/>
they tore Joseph’s coat and put<break time="2s"/> some blood from an animal on it.<break time="2s"/>
They wanted it to look like<break time="2s"/> a wild animal had killed him.<break time="2s"/>

In a few days they got all the cows<break time="2s"/> and sheep and goats together and started for home.<break time="2s"/>

The first thing Jacob said<break time="2s"/> when he saw the brothers was,<break time="2s"/>

“Joseph? Isn’t he with<break time="2s"/> you?” the brothers asked.<break time="2s"/>

“No! no!” said Jacob,<break time="1.3s"/>
“I sent him<break time="2s"/> to find you.<break time="2s"/>

Then the brothers<break time="2s"/> acted sad and worried.<break time="2s"/>
Slowly they brought out the torn<break time="2s"/> coat with blood stains on it.<break time="2s"/>
“We found this<break time="2s"/> in a field,<break time="2s"/>
” they said,<break time="1s"/>
as they gave<break time="2s"/> Joseph’s coat to Jacob.<break time="2s"/>
“Could it be Joseph’s coat?<break time="2s"/> It looks something like it.<break time="2s"/>

“It is my son’s<break time="2s"/> coat!” Jacob cried out.<break time="2s"/>
“It is the<break time="2s"/> one I gave him.<break time="2s"/>
A wild animal<break time="2s"/> has killed him.<break time="2s"/>

Poor Jacob! For days<break time="2s"/> and weeks he was sad.<break time="2s"/>
His sons and daughter<break time="2s"/> tried to comfort him,<break time="2s"/>
but they could not.<break time="1.3s"/>
His dear son,<break time="1s"/>
Joseph,<break time="0.5s"/>

The brothers felt sorry when they<break time="2s"/> saw how sad their father was.<break time="2s"/>
But they did not tell<break time="2s"/> anyone what they had done.<break time="2s"/>
They thought their<break time="2s"/> father would never know.<break time="2s"/>
But they had<break time="2s"/> forgotten one thing.<break time="2s"/>
They had forgotten God.<break time="1.3s"/>
God had a<break time="2s"/> plan for Joseph’s life.<break time="2s"/>
He would be with Joseph and<break time="2s"/> care of him wherever he went.<break time="2s"/>

When you are afraid,<break time="1.3s"/>
remember Joseph.<break time="1s"/>
God will be with<break time="2s"/> you and care for you,<break time="2s"/>
too,<break time="0.5s"/>
if you ask Him.<break time="1.3s"/>
Talk to Him right now.<break time="1.8s"/>
Learn the little prayer below.<break time="1.8s"/>
