<break time="0.5s"/>“Why would God let this<break time="2s"/> happen to me?” Joseph wondered.<break time="2s"/>
The chains hurt his feet,<break time="1.8s"/>
and prison was not<break time="2s"/> a nice place to be.<break time="2s"/>
But Joseph knew that God<break time="2s"/> was with him even here.<break time="2s"/>
He would be the<break time="2s"/> best prisoner in this prison.<break time="2s"/>

The keeper of the prison saw<break time="2s"/> how good and kind Joseph was.<break time="2s"/>
He took all<break time="2s"/> the chains off.<break time="2s"/>

The keeper gave<break time="2s"/> Joseph work to do.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was glad to help.<break time="1.8s"/>
Soon he asked Joseph to<break time="2s"/> take care of all the prisoners.<break time="2s"/>
God was with<break time="2s"/> Joseph and helped him.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph was kind<break time="2s"/> to the prisoners.<break time="2s"/>
He told them<break time="2s"/> of God’s love.<break time="2s"/>
It made them feel better.<break time="1.8s"/>

One day two new men<break time="2s"/> were put into the prison.<break time="2s"/>
They came from Pharaoh’s palace.<break time="1.8s"/>
They were two<break time="2s"/> of Pharaoh’s workers.<break time="2s"/>
One of them,<break time="1s"/>
the butler,<break time="1s"/>
took care of<break time="2s"/> the king’s drinks.<break time="2s"/>
The other one,<break time="1s"/>
the baker,<break time="1s"/>
baked bread and cakes<break time="2s"/> for Pharaoh and his family.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph liked to<break time="2s"/> talk to these men.<break time="2s"/>
They told him news<break time="2s"/> of things happening in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>

One morning Joseph saw that<break time="2s"/> the two new prisoners looked sad.<break time="2s"/>
“Why are you<break time="2s"/> sad?” he asked.<break time="2s"/>

“We have each<break time="2s"/> had a dream,<break time="2s"/>
” they said.<break time="1s"/>
“We don’t know<break time="2s"/> what our dreams mean.<break time="2s"/>

Dreams! Joseph thought<break time="2s"/> of his two dreams.<break time="2s"/>
“My God,<break time="1s"/>
the God of heaven,<break time="1.3s"/>
can give the<break time="2s"/> meanings of dreams,<break time="2s"/>
” Joseph said.<break time="1s"/>
“Tell me your dreams.<break time="1.3s"/>

The butler said,<break time="1s"/>
“In my dream I saw<break time="2s"/> a grapevine with three branches.<break time="2s"/>
There were grapes<break time="2s"/> on the branches.<break time="2s"/>
I picked the grapes and<break time="2s"/> squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup.<break time="2s"/>
Then I gave the juice<break time="2s"/> to the king to drink.<break time="2s"/>
” The butler looked<break time="2s"/> at Joseph for an answer.<break time="2s"/>

God helped Joseph tell<break time="2s"/> the meaning of the dream.<break time="2s"/>
“In three days Pharaoh will take you<break time="2s"/> back into the palace to work for him,<break time="2s"/>
” Joseph said.<break time="1s"/>

“When you are<break time="2s"/> in the palace again,<break time="2s"/>
think of me,<break time="1s"/>
” said Joseph.<break time="1s"/>
“Please talk to<break time="2s"/> Pharaoh about me.<break time="2s"/>
I was put into prison<break time="2s"/> for something I didn’t do.<break time="2s"/>

“I will remember,<break time="1s"/>
” said the butler.<break time="1.3s"/>

Now it was<break time="2s"/> the baker’s turn.<break time="2s"/>
He told his dream.<break time="1.3s"/>
“I had three<break time="2s"/> baskets on my head,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“There were cakes for<break time="2s"/> Pharaoh in the top basket.<break time="2s"/>
Birds came and ate<break time="2s"/> the cakes from the basket.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph felt sad when he told<break time="2s"/> the baker what his dream meant.<break time="2s"/>
“In three days you will<break time="2s"/> be called back to the palace,<break time="2s"/>
too,<break time="0.5s"/>
” Joseph told the baker.<break time="1.8s"/>
“But the king will not<break time="2s"/> take you back to work.<break time="2s"/>

Three days later,<break time="1s"/>
the two dreams came true.<break time="1.8s"/>
It happened just as<break time="2s"/> Joseph said it would.<break time="2s"/>
But the butler<break time="2s"/> forgot about Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
