Nineveh was the
 capital city of Assyria.
It was a great city,
but the people of
 this city were wicked.@@@

God loved the
 wicked people in Nineveh.
He wanted them to love
 Him and repent of their evil.
So God said
 to his prophet Jonah,
“Go to Nineveh.
Tell them that because of their wickedness I
 am going to destroy their city in forty days.
” God knew that message
 would make them stop and think.@@@

Jonah was afraid
 to go to Nineveh.
He made a plan.
He would go so far away
 that God could not find him.
For three days Jonah ran along the
 shore away from Nineveh and reached Joppa,
a seaport.
There he got into
 a ship going to Tarshish,
a faraway city.@@@

Being very tired from his three-day
 trip of running away from God,
he slept in a corner
 at the bottom of the ship.
The ship started sailing.@@@

Soon great winds
 began to blow.
The ship tossed
 up and down.
The captain was afraid.@@@

Everyone in the ship shouted
 to their gods for help.
They threw the cargo
 out to lighten the ship.@@@

But Jonah was sound asleep.
The captain woke him up and asked
 him to pray to his God for help.
Then they cast lots to see
 who had made the gods angry.
The lot fell on Jonah.@@@

Jonah admitted that he was
 running away from his God.
“Throw me out
 into the sea,
” he said.
They waited for a while to
 see if the storm would calm down,
but it did not.
Sadly,@@@

As Jonah went down,
down into the sea he
 suddenly felt something warm around him.
He was being swallowed
 by a huge fish.@@@

For one whole day and parts of
 two other days Jonah was inside the fish.
He thought about the God whom he
 had loved and served for many years.
He promised God that
 he would obey Him.
He asked God
 to save him.@@@

God guided the
 fish to the shore.
He caused it to vomit
 out Jonah upon the sand.
Jonah did as God
 had asked him to do.
Immediately he started
 walking along the beach.
He was going to Nineveh.
