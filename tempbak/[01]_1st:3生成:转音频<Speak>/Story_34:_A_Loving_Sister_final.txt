<break time="0.5s"/>It was very<break time="2s"/> early in the morning.<break time="2s"/>
It was dark.<break time="1s"/>
It was so dark that<break time="2s"/> some stars were still shining.<break time="2s"/>
Jochabed held her little<break time="2s"/> son Moses in her arms.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam carried the basket.<break time="1.3s"/>

They opened the door<break time="2s"/> and left their little house.<break time="2s"/>
They tiptoed through the<break time="2s"/> narrow streets of the village.<break time="2s"/>
They walked quietly<break time="2s"/> across a field.<break time="2s"/>
Then they walked along the<break time="2s"/> side of the River Nile.<break time="2s"/>

“This is a good place,<break time="1.8s"/>
” Mother whispered.<break time="1s"/>
They stopped.<break time="1s"/>
Miriam opened the basket.<break time="1.3s"/>
Mother put the sleeping<break time="2s"/> baby on the pillow inside.<break time="2s"/>
Then Mother and Miriam<break time="2s"/> prayed to God together.<break time="2s"/>

“Please keep our baby safe,<break time="1.8s"/>
” Miriam prayed.<break time="1s"/>
Mother put the basket boat in the<break time="2s"/> river and pushed it away from the bank.<break time="2s"/>
It rocked between the reeds.<break time="1.8s"/>

“I must go now,<break time="1.3s"/>
Miriam,<break time="0.5s"/>
” said Mother.<break time="1s"/>
“God will keep<break time="2s"/> you both safe.<break time="2s"/>
” Mother kissed<break time="2s"/> Miriam and hurried away.<break time="2s"/>
But the children<break time="2s"/> were not alone.<break time="2s"/>
God had sent angels<break time="2s"/> to watch over them.<break time="2s"/>

Daylight came.<break time="1s"/>
Time went by.<break time="1s"/>
Miriam kept watching the<break time="2s"/> little basket with its secret.<break time="2s"/>
She heard the<break time="2s"/> croak of a frog.<break time="2s"/>
She did not know that at that very moment Pharaoh’s<break time="2s"/> daughter was coming with her maids to bathe in the river.<break time="2s"/>
She did not know that angels were guiding the princess<break time="2s"/> to the very spot where the basket was rocking gently.<break time="2s"/>

Suddenly Miriam heard voices! Were soldiers<break time="2s"/> near? Miriam’s heart beat very fast.<break time="2s"/>
She listened.<break time="1s"/>
No,<break time="0.5s"/>
not soldiers.<break time="1s"/>
She heard happy women’s voices.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then she saw the beautiful princess<break time="2s"/> and her maids walking to the river.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam watched them from among<break time="2s"/> the reeds where she was standing.<break time="2s"/>

Miriam was afraid.<break time="1s"/>
But the princess<break time="2s"/> had a kind face.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam saw the princess pointing<break time="2s"/> to the little basket boat.<break time="2s"/>
“What is that?” the<break time="2s"/> princess asked her maids.<break time="2s"/>
“Go bring it to me.<break time="1.8s"/>

One of the maids<break time="2s"/> waded out into the water.<break time="2s"/>
She brought the<break time="2s"/> basket to the shore.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam held her breath as she watched<break time="2s"/> the princess lift the cover and look inside.<break time="2s"/>

The baby woke up.<break time="1.3s"/>
He reached up his little<break time="2s"/> arms and started to cry.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam heard her brother cry.<break time="1.8s"/>
