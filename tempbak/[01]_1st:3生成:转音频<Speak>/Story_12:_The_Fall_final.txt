<break time="0.5s"/>God told Adam and Eve that they could eat<break time="2s"/> fruit from all the trees in the garden except one.<break time="2s"/>
God told them they would die<break time="2s"/> if they ate from the forbidden tree.<break time="2s"/>

One day Eve was<break time="2s"/> near the forbidden tree.<break time="2s"/>
She looked at the<break time="2s"/> beautiful fruit on the tree.<break time="2s"/>
"I wonder why God said<break time="2s"/> we should not eat that fruit,<break time="2s"/>
" she said.<break time="1s"/>

As Eve stood there,<break time="1.3s"/>
she heard a<break time="2s"/> voice talking to her.<break time="2s"/>
Who could it be? A snake with lovely wings<break time="2s"/> was resting on one of the branches of the tree.<break time="2s"/>
A snake cannot talk,<break time="1.3s"/>
but Satan was<break time="2s"/> talking through the snake.<break time="2s"/>
Eve walked closer<break time="2s"/> to the tree.<break time="2s"/>

"Did God say you should not eat fruit<break time="2s"/> from the trees in the garden?" Satan asked.<break time="2s"/>
Eve told Satan that they could eat<break time="2s"/> fruit from all the trees but this one.<break time="2s"/>

"If we eat<break time="2s"/> fruit from this tree,<break time="2s"/>
God said that<break time="2s"/> we would die,<break time="2s"/>
" Eve said.<break time="1s"/>

"Oh no,<break time="1s"/>
you won’t die,<break time="1s"/>
" Satan lied.<break time="1s"/>
"If you eat this fruit,<break time="1.8s"/>
you will be very wise.<break time="1.8s"/>
I’m eating the fruit.<break time="1.3s"/>
Here,<break time="0.5s"/>
take some.<break time="1s"/>

Eve should have run away.<break time="1.8s"/>
But she didn’t.<break time="1s"/>
She took the<break time="2s"/> fruit in her hand.<break time="2s"/>
Then she tasted<break time="2s"/> a tiny bite.<break time="2s"/>
It was very delicious.<break time="1.3s"/>
Then Eve ate some more.<break time="1.8s"/>
Eve took more fruit<break time="2s"/> and ran to find Adam.<break time="2s"/>
She told him about<break time="2s"/> the snake that could talk.<break time="2s"/>
"Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
Eve,<break time="0.5s"/>
" Adam cried,<break time="1s"/>
"That must be the enemy God<break time="2s"/> told us about! You have disobeyed God.<break time="2s"/>
Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
Eve,<break time="0.5s"/>

Adam loved his wife.<break time="1.3s"/>
"She will soon die,<break time="1.3s"/>
" he thought.<break time="1s"/>
Should he obey God? "No,<break time="1.8s"/>
" he decided.<break time="1s"/>
"If Eve dies,<break time="1s"/>
I will die with her.<break time="1.8s"/>
" He took some<break time="2s"/> fruit and ate it quickly.<break time="2s"/>

Satan and his<break time="2s"/> angels were happy.<break time="2s"/>
But there was<break time="2s"/> sadness in heaven.<break time="2s"/>
Disobedience had come to<break time="2s"/> the Garden of Eden.<break time="2s"/>
Sin had come<break time="2s"/> to the beautiful,<break time="2s"/>
good world God had made.<break time="1.8s"/>
