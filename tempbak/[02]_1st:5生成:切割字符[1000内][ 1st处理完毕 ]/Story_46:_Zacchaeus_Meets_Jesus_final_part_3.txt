” this man said.<break time="1.3s"/>
“One of them<break time="2s"/> was a tax collector.<break time="2s"/>

When Zacchaeus heard that,<break time="1.3s"/>
he thought,<break time="1s"/>
“Jesus has a tax collector for a<break time="2s"/> special friend! Maybe there is hope for me.<break time="2s"/>

At once he began making things<break time="2s"/> right with people whom he had cheated.<break time="2s"/>
He gave food and clothing<break time="2s"/> and gifts to poor people.<break time="2s"/>
For the first time in his<break time="2s"/> life he began to feel happy.<break time="2s"/>

One day Zacchaeus looked up from the<break time="2s"/> money he was counting in his tax booth.<break time="2s"/>
He saw a crowd of<break time="2s"/> people coming down the street.<break time="2s"/>
“What’s all the<break time="2s"/> excitement?” he called.<break time="2s"/>

“Jesus is passing<break time="2s"/> through our city,<break time="2s"/>
