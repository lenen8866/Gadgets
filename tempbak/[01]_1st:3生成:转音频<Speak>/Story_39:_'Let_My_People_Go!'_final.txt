<break time="0.5s"/>When Moses was on<break time="2s"/> his way to Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
he met his brother Aaron.<break time="1.8s"/>
How happy the brothers were to see each<break time="2s"/> other again! There was so much to talk about.<break time="2s"/>
But the most exciting thing was that Moses was<break time="2s"/> to lead the Israelite people out of Egypt very soon.<break time="2s"/>
Aaron would help him.<break time="1.3s"/>
God's people would not<break time="2s"/> be slaves any more.<break time="2s"/>
They would live in a<break time="2s"/> beautiful land and be free.<break time="2s"/>
Moses and Aaron talked and<break time="2s"/> talked as they walked to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>

When they got there,<break time="1.3s"/>
they went to Goshen<break time="2s"/> where the Israelites lived.<break time="2s"/>
They called some of the men<break time="2s"/> to have a meeting with them.<break time="2s"/>
They told the men<break time="2s"/> what God had said.<break time="2s"/>

Then Moses and Aaron<break time="2s"/> went to see Pharaoh.<break time="2s"/>
They told him that God<break time="2s"/> wanted the Israelites to leave Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
They told him<break time="2s"/> that God had said,<break time="2s"/>
'Let My people go.<break time="1.3s"/>

Pharaoh was very angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
'Who is God? Why should I<break time="2s"/> obey Him? I do not know Him.<break time="2s"/>
I will not<break time="2s"/> let the people go.<break time="2s"/>

Then Pharaoh told the slave masters to<break time="2s"/> make the people work harder than ever.<break time="2s"/>
He would not give them<break time="2s"/> straw to make bricks any more.<break time="2s"/>
The slaves had to<break time="2s"/> find their own straw.<break time="2s"/>
It was very,<break time="1s"/>
very hard.<break time="1s"/>
The slave masters whipped the Israelites' backs and<break time="2s"/> legs when they could not work fast enough.<break time="2s"/>

Some of the people<break time="2s"/> went to talk to Pharaoh.<break time="2s"/>
'Our work is too hard,<break time="1.8s"/>
' they said.<break time="1s"/>
'We canâ€™t make so many<break time="2s"/> bricks and find the straw too.<break time="2s"/>

Pharaoh just said,<break time="1s"/>
'You are lazy! We<break time="2s"/> will not give you straw.<break time="2s"/>
Go back to work again.<break time="1.8s"/>

The people talked<break time="2s"/> to Moses and Aaron.<break time="2s"/>
'You have made<break time="2s"/> us have harder work,<break time="2s"/>
' they said.<break time="1s"/>

Moses was sad.<break time="1s"/>
'Dear God,<break time="1s"/>
' he prayed,<break time="1s"/>
'why did you send me here? The<break time="2s"/> people have to work harder than before.<break time="2s"/>

God told Moses to tell the<break time="2s"/> people that He would help them.<break time="2s"/>
But first God would show His mighty<break time="2s"/> power to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Then they would learn that<break time="2s"/> He was the true God.<break time="2s"/>
