from now on I will give<break time="2s"/> half of my money to the poor.<break time="2s"/>
And to anyone<break time="2s"/> I have cheated,<break time="2s"/>
I will give back four times<break time="2s"/> as much as I have taken.<break time="2s"/>

Zacchaeus was filled with<break time="2s"/> joy when Jesus said,<break time="2s"/>
“Today salvation has<break time="2s"/> come to your house.<break time="2s"/>
” He knew<break time="2s"/> his sins were forgiven.<break time="2s"/>

Zacchaeus and Jesus had a<break time="2s"/> wonderful time together that day.<break time="2s"/>
