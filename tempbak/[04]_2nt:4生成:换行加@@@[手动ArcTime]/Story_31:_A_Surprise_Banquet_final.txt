The brothers left
 Egypt in a hurry.
When they stopped for the night
 one of the brothers opened his sack.
There was his money! “How did
 your money get there?” the brothers asked.
They were afraid.
Then they all found
 money in their sacks.@@@

When they got home they
 told Jacob all that had happened.
Jacob was sad.
“My son Benjamin shall
 not go to Egypt,
” he said.
“His brother Joseph is dead.
If anything happens to Benjamin,
I will die.@@@

It was good to have the
 food the brothers had brought from Egypt,
but no one
 was very happy.
They wondered what would happen
 when this food was gone.@@@

That time came soon.
Jacob told his sons to
 go back to Egypt for food.
Judah said,
“The man will not even let us
 see him if we don’t bring Benjamin.
We will not go
 unless Benjamin is with us.
” Finally Jacob said
 they could take Benjamin.
“And take the
 money with you.
We will send some
 gifts to the governor too.@@@

When the brothers
 got to Egypt,
they went right to the
 governor and bowed down before him.
When Joseph saw
 Benjamin he was happy.
He said to
 one of his helpers,
“Take these men
 to my palace.
Make food for them.
I want them to
 eat with me today.@@@

The brothers were afraid.
Why were they being sent to the governor’s palace?
 “It must be because of the money in our sacks,
” they said
 to each other.@@@

Joseph’s servant opened the door for
 them and took them into Joseph’s palace.
He took them to a room where they
 could rest until it was time to eat.@@@

Simeon was brought from prison.@@@

When Joseph came in they
 bowed down to him again.
Then they gave him
 the gifts they had brought.
Joseph asked them,@@@

“Yes,
our father is well,
” they answered.@@@

“And is this your youngest
 brother?” Joseph asked looking at Benjamin.@@@

Joseph wanted to find out
 if his brothers were still unkind.
Were they jealous of Benjamin like they had been
 of him? He knew they must all be very hungry.
A good meal was
 ready for the brothers.
There was food
 for all of them,
but Joseph gave Benjamin five times as
 much food as he gave the others.
He listened to the brothers
 talking and heard only kind words.
After the dinner,
Joseph had the men’s
 sacks filled with grain.
He had a servant put
 his silver cup in Benjamin’s sack.@@@

The brothers started for home.
They were happy.
Simeon was with them.
Benjamin was safe.@@@

They had not gone far when
 they heard a horse galloping behind them.
Joseph’s helper was
 on the horse,
and he looked very angry.
“Why have you stolen the
 governor’s silver cup?” he asked.@@@

“We haven’t stolen anything,
” the brothers answered.
“You can look
 in our sacks.
If you find the cup,
we will all
 be your servants.
” The man began
 to open the sacks.
How sad the brothers felt when
 the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Joseph’s servant told the
 brothers they could go home.
Only Benjamin would
 have to come back,
but all the
 brothers went back.
They would not let
 Benjamin go back alone.
