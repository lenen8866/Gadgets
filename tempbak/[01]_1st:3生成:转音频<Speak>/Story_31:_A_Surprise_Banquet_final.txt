<break time="0.5s"/>The brothers left<break time="2s"/> Egypt in a hurry.<break time="2s"/>
When they stopped for the night<break time="2s"/> one of the brothers opened his sack.<break time="2s"/>
There was his money! “How did<break time="2s"/> your money get there?” the brothers asked.<break time="2s"/>
They were afraid.<break time="1s"/>
Then they all found<break time="2s"/> money in their sacks.<break time="2s"/>

When they got home they<break time="2s"/> told Jacob all that had happened.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob was sad.<break time="1s"/>
“My son Benjamin shall<break time="2s"/> not go to Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“His brother Joseph is dead.<break time="1.8s"/>
If anything happens to Benjamin,<break time="1.8s"/>
I will die.<break time="1s"/>

It was good to have the<break time="2s"/> food the brothers had brought from Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
but no one<break time="2s"/> was very happy.<break time="2s"/>
They wondered what would happen<break time="2s"/> when this food was gone.<break time="2s"/>

That time came soon.<break time="1.3s"/>
Jacob told his sons to<break time="2s"/> go back to Egypt for food.<break time="2s"/>
Judah said,<break time="1s"/>
“The man will not even let us<break time="2s"/> see him if we don’t bring Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>
We will not go<break time="2s"/> unless Benjamin is with us.<break time="2s"/>
” Finally Jacob said<break time="2s"/> they could take Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>
“And take the<break time="2s"/> money with you.<break time="2s"/>
We will send some<break time="2s"/> gifts to the governor too.<break time="2s"/>

When the brothers<break time="2s"/> got to Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
they went right to the<break time="2s"/> governor and bowed down before him.<break time="2s"/>
When Joseph saw<break time="2s"/> Benjamin he was happy.<break time="2s"/>
He said to<break time="2s"/> one of his helpers,<break time="2s"/>
“Take these men<break time="2s"/> to my palace.<break time="2s"/>
Make food for them.<break time="1.3s"/>
I want them to<break time="2s"/> eat with me today.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers were afraid.<break time="1.3s"/>
Why were they being sent to the governor’s palace?<break time="2s"/> “It must be because of the money in our sacks,<break time="2s"/>
” they said<break time="2s"/> to each other.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph’s servant opened the door for<break time="2s"/> them and took them into Joseph’s palace.<break time="2s"/>
He took them to a room where they<break time="2s"/> could rest until it was time to eat.<break time="2s"/>

Simeon was brought from prison.<break time="1.8s"/>

When Joseph came in they<break time="2s"/> bowed down to him again.<break time="2s"/>
Then they gave him<break time="2s"/> the gifts they had brought.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph asked them,<break time="1s"/>

“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
our father is well,<break time="1.3s"/>
” they answered.<break time="1s"/>

“And is this your youngest<break time="2s"/> brother?” Joseph asked looking at Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph wanted to find out<break time="2s"/> if his brothers were still unkind.<break time="2s"/>
Were they jealous of Benjamin like they had been<break time="2s"/> of him? He knew they must all be very hungry.<break time="2s"/>
A good meal was<break time="2s"/> ready for the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
There was food<break time="2s"/> for all of them,<break time="2s"/>
but Joseph gave Benjamin five times as<break time="2s"/> much food as he gave the others.<break time="2s"/>
He listened to the brothers<break time="2s"/> talking and heard only kind words.<break time="2s"/>
After the dinner,<break time="1s"/>
Joseph had the men’s<break time="2s"/> sacks filled with grain.<break time="2s"/>
He had a servant put<break time="2s"/> his silver cup in Benjamin’s sack.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers started for home.<break time="1.8s"/>
They were happy.<break time="1s"/>
Simeon was with them.<break time="1.3s"/>
Benjamin was safe.<break time="1s"/>

They had not gone far when<break time="2s"/> they heard a horse galloping behind them.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph’s helper was<break time="2s"/> on the horse,<break time="2s"/>
and he looked very angry.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Why have you stolen the<break time="2s"/> governor’s silver cup?” he asked.<break time="2s"/>

“We haven’t stolen anything,<break time="1.3s"/>
” the brothers answered.<break time="1.3s"/>
“You can look<break time="2s"/> in our sacks.<break time="2s"/>
If you find the cup,<break time="1.8s"/>
we will all<break time="2s"/> be your servants.<break time="2s"/>
” The man began<break time="2s"/> to open the sacks.<break time="2s"/>
How sad the brothers felt when<break time="2s"/> the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph’s servant told the<break time="2s"/> brothers they could go home.<break time="2s"/>
Only Benjamin would<break time="2s"/> have to come back,<break time="2s"/>
but all the<break time="2s"/> brothers went back.<break time="2s"/>
They would not let<break time="2s"/> Benjamin go back alone.<break time="2s"/>
