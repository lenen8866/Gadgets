Adam and Eve lived
 in the Garden of Eden.
The beautiful garden
 home had the bright,
sunny sky for a roof.
It had thick green
 grass for a carpet,
and tall,
strong trees for the walls.
It was fun to live
 and work in the garden.@@@

Adam and Eve liked to
 learn about all the animals.
They might have had
 rides on horses and elephants.
All the animals
 were tame and friendly.
The birds were building their
 nests and singing happy songs.
They were not afraid
 of Adam and Eve.@@@

There were many different kinds
 of flowers and trees to enjoy.
Some trees had delicious fruit
 for Adam and Eve to eat.
They must have liked to taste
 all the good food God had created.@@@

Adam and Eve
 were not lonely.
Angels came to visit them.
The angels helped them
 to learn more about God.
They taught them about the
 things God had made for them,
too.
In the evenings
 and on Sabbaths,
Jesus,
God's Son,
came to visit.
Adam and Eve
 loved that time.
They would run
 to meet their Creator.
