One night Joseph
 had a strange dream.
He woke up in
 the morning thinking about it.
He did not know that an
 angel had given him the dream.@@@

Joseph told his
 brothers about it.
“Listen to my dream,
” he said.
“It’s about you! I dreamed
 we were working in the field.
We were tying
 the grain into bundles.@@@

“No,
what?” the brothers asked.@@@

“Well,
suddenly my bundle stood straight up! Then all
 your bundles stood up and bowed to mine.@@@

The brothers were angry.
They all began
 to talk at once.
“Who do you think
 you are?” they asked.
“Do you think you’ll be a king? We won’t bow
 down to you!” Joseph knew they did not like him.@@@

Then a few nights later the angel
 came back with another dream for Joseph.
He wondered if he should
 tell this dream to his brothers.
The dream was so real.
So he told his
 father and his brothers,
too.@@@

“I dreamed another dream,
” he said.
“This time,
the sun and moon and eleven
 stars were bowing down to me.@@@

Father Jacob said,
“What is this dream?
 Are you saying that we,
your brothers and I,
will bow down to you?” The brothers looked
 very angry and said things that were not kind.@@@

Joseph didn’t say any more.
But he wondered if God was
 telling him something in his dreams.
