Moses and Aaron went
 to talk to Pharaoh again,
but the king
 would not listen.
He would not
 let the Israelites go.
Then some bad plagues came
 to the people of Egypt.
First,
the Nile River
 was turned to blood.
All the water
 in Egypt became blood.
But Pharaoh would
 not obey God.
He would not let
 the people of Israel go.@@@

Then God let more bad plagues
 come to the people of Egypt.
Frogs were everywhere.
They came into the houses.
They were in the beds.
They were in the food.
The king asked his wisemen
 to make the frogs go away,
but they could
 not do it.@@@

Then Pharaoh called
 for Moses to come.
He said,
"Pray to your God to
 make the frogs go away.
Then I will
 let your people go.
" Moses prayed.
All the frogs died.
However,
the king would not
 let the people go.@@@

Then more plagues came.
Many flies were
 all over Egypt.
But the flies were not in
 Goshen where the people of Israel lived.@@@

There were ten
 plagues in all.
The animals got
 a bad sickness.
Many horses,
cows,
donkeys,
and camels died.
None of the
 animals in Goshen died.
God protected these animals.@@@

A big storm
 came to Egypt.
Rain poured down
 and big hailstones fell.
Trees were knocked down.
The gardens were spoiled.
People who were outside their
 houses were killed by the hailstones.@@@

It got very
 dark in Egypt,
but it was
 light in Goshen.
Still Pharaoh would not
 let the people go.@@@

At last Moses
 went to Pharaoh again.
He told Pharaoh that the next plague would be the worst of all: The
 oldest child in every family would die if Pharaoh did not let the people go.@@@

Then Moses went to Goshen.
He talked to God’s people.
He told them to
 get ready to leave Egypt.
He told them to ask their neighbors
 for gifts of jewels and silver and gold.
He told them to kill a lamb and put
 the blood on the top and sides of their doors.
"Then the angel of death
 will pass over your house,
" he said.
"Your oldest child
 will not die.@@@

The last night
 in Egypt came.
At midnight a child died
 in nearly every home in Egypt.
Even Pharaoh’s oldest son died.
But the children of the
 people in Goshen did not die.
The angel saw the blood on
 their doors and passed over their houses.@@@

Pharaoh mourned for his son.
He said,
"Tell Moses to go with
 all the people and their animals.@@@

In the middle of the night God’s
 people began to march out of Egypt.
They were happy.
"We are free!" they shouted.
