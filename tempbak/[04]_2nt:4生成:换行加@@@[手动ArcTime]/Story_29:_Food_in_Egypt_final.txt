No more prison for Joseph! God
 had been with Joseph in Potiphar’s house.
He had been with
 him in the prison.
Now God was with Joseph
 as he worked for the king.
He had workmen
 build big storehouses.
Then he bought
 grain from the farmers.
Storehouse after storehouse was filled.
He was getting ready for
 the bad years to come.@@@

Joseph got married.
He was very happy
 in his home in Egypt.
Soon he had two
 little boys of his own.
He taught the boys
 about the God of heaven.
He told them all the stories he had heard from
 his father and grandfather when he was a little boy.@@@

The people in
 Egypt loved Joseph.
He was kind to them
 and told them about his God.
After seven good
 years had passed,
the famine came.
No rain fell.
The fruit trees were dying.
There was no
 grass for the animals.
The people ate all the
 food they had at home.
Then they went to Pharaoh.
“Go to Joseph,
” he said.
Joseph opened the storehouses and
 began selling food to the people.
