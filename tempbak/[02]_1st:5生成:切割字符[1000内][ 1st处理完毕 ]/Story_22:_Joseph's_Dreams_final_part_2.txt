“Who do you think<break time="2s"/> you are?” they asked.<break time="2s"/>
“Do you think you’ll be a king? We won’t bow<break time="2s"/> down to you!” Joseph knew they did not like him.<break time="2s"/>

Then a few nights later the angel<break time="2s"/> came back with another dream for Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
He wondered if he should<break time="2s"/> tell this dream to his brothers.<break time="2s"/>
The dream was so real.<break time="1.8s"/>
So he told his<break time="2s"/> father and his brothers,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

“I dreamed another dream,<break time="1.3s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“This time,<break time="1s"/>
the sun and moon and eleven<break time="2s"/> stars were bowing down to me.<break time="2s"/>

Father Jacob said,<break time="1s"/>
“What is this dream?<break time="2s"/> Are you saying that we,<break time="2s"/>
your brothers and I,<break time="1.3s"/>
