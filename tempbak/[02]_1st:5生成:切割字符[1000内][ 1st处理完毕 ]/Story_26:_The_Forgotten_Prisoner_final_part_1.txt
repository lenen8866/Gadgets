<break time="0.5s"/>“Why would God let this<break time="2s"/> happen to me?” Joseph wondered.<break time="2s"/>
The chains hurt his feet,<break time="1.8s"/>
and prison was not<break time="2s"/> a nice place to be.<break time="2s"/>
But Joseph knew that God<break time="2s"/> was with him even here.<break time="2s"/>
He would be the<break time="2s"/> best prisoner in this prison.<break time="2s"/>

The keeper of the prison saw<break time="2s"/> how good and kind Joseph was.<break time="2s"/>
He took all<break time="2s"/> the chains off.<break time="2s"/>

The keeper gave<break time="2s"/> Joseph work to do.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was glad to help.<break time="1.8s"/>
Soon he asked Joseph to<break time="2s"/> take care of all the prisoners.<break time="2s"/>
God was with<break time="2s"/> Joseph and helped him.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph was kind<break time="2s"/> to the prisoners.<break time="2s"/>
