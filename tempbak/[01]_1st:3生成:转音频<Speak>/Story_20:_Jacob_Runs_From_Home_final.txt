<break time="0.5s"/>Esau was very angry when he<break time="2s"/> found out Jacob had tricked his father.<break time="2s"/>
Isaac had given the<break time="2s"/> birthright blessing to Jacob.<break time="2s"/>
“I will hurt<break time="2s"/> Jacob for this,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>

Rebekah found out<break time="2s"/> about Esau’s angry words.<break time="2s"/>
She called Jacob to her.<break time="1.8s"/>
“My son,<break time="1s"/>
” she said,<break time="1s"/>
“Your brother wants<break time="2s"/> to hurt you.<break time="2s"/>
Go away quickly to<break time="2s"/> my brother’s house in Haran.<break time="2s"/>
When Esau gets<break time="2s"/> over his anger,<break time="2s"/>
I will send someone to tell<break time="2s"/> you to come back to me.<break time="2s"/>
” Jacob said<break time="2s"/> good-bye to his father.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob and his mother<break time="2s"/> cried when they said good-bye.<break time="2s"/>
They did not know that they<break time="2s"/> would never see each other again.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob was sad and<break time="2s"/> afraid as he hurried away.<break time="2s"/>
Soon it was dark,<break time="1.3s"/>
but he kept going.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was afraid that Esau would<break time="2s"/> come after him and kill him.<break time="2s"/>
He knew he had done<break time="2s"/> wrong to lie to his father.<break time="2s"/>
He should have trusted God<break time="2s"/> to take care of the birthright.<break time="2s"/>

“I am alone<break time="2s"/> without Mother or Father,<break time="2s"/>
” he cried.<break time="1s"/>
“Even God is not<break time="2s"/> with me any more.<break time="2s"/>
” All the next<break time="2s"/> day he hurried on.<break time="2s"/>
He didn’t want<break time="2s"/> anyone to see him.<break time="2s"/>
They might tell<break time="2s"/> Esau where he was.<break time="2s"/>
He found a place in<break time="2s"/> the woods to spend the night.<break time="2s"/>
He felt he<break time="2s"/> could not pray.<break time="2s"/>
He could not sleep.<break time="1.3s"/>
Then he began calling to<break time="2s"/> God to forgive his sins.<break time="2s"/>
At last,<break time="1s"/>
with his head on<break time="2s"/> a rock for a pillow,<break time="2s"/>
he fell asleep.<break time="1s"/>

God had been with<break time="2s"/> Jacob all the time.<break time="2s"/>
He had not left him.<break time="1.8s"/>
He felt very<break time="2s"/> sorry for Jacob.<break time="2s"/>
He was glad that Jacob was<break time="2s"/> sorry for what he had done.<break time="2s"/>
Now God did<break time="2s"/> something special for him.<break time="2s"/>
He gave Jacob<break time="2s"/> a beautiful dream.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob saw the bottom of a<break time="2s"/> ladder on the ground right beside him.<break time="2s"/>
It went up,<break time="1s"/>
up until the top<break time="2s"/> of the ladder reached heaven.<break time="2s"/>
Beautiful angels were going<break time="2s"/> up and down the ladder.<break time="2s"/>
At the very<break time="2s"/> top was God Himself.<break time="2s"/>
God talked to<break time="2s"/> Jacob in the dream.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“I am with you.<break time="1.3s"/>
I will take care<break time="2s"/> of you wherever you go.<break time="2s"/>
I will bring you<break time="2s"/> back to this land.<break time="2s"/>
I will not leave you.<break time="1.8s"/>

Jacob woke up happy.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Surely the Lord is in this<break time="2s"/> place and I didn’t know it.<break time="2s"/>
God is with me.<break time="1.3s"/>
He has forgiven my sins.<break time="1.8s"/>
I will have only<break time="2s"/> you for my God,<break time="2s"/>
” he promised.<break time="1s"/>
Before he left he set up the<break time="2s"/> stone he had used for a pillow.<break time="2s"/>
He named the place Bethel,<break time="1.8s"/>
which means “house of God.<break time="1.8s"/>
” Then he went<break time="2s"/> happily on his way.<break time="2s"/>
He was sure that<break time="2s"/> God was with him.<break time="2s"/>

It was a long way<break time="2s"/> to his Uncle Laban’s house.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob walked and walked.<break time="1.3s"/>
When he got there,<break time="1.3s"/>
his Uncle Laban was<break time="2s"/> very happy to see him.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob stayed there a long<break time="2s"/> time and worked for Laban.<break time="2s"/>
God blessed all<break time="2s"/> of Jacob’s work.<break time="2s"/>

He got married<break time="2s"/> and had children.<break time="2s"/>
Then he decided to go<break time="2s"/> back to his home in Canaan.<break time="2s"/>
His mother had died,<break time="1.3s"/>
but his father<break time="2s"/> was still alive.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob was afraid of<break time="2s"/> meeting his brother Esau.<break time="2s"/>
Before they met,<break time="1s"/>
Jacob prayed all night.<break time="1.3s"/>
The next morning Esau forgave him<break time="2s"/> and the brothers were friends again.<break time="2s"/>
