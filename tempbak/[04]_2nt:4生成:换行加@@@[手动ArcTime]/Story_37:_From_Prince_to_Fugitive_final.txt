Moses lived in
 the king’s palace.
His princess mother taught him how
 to live in his new home.
He grew to
 be a man.
Even though Pharaoh’s family didn’t
 worship the God of heaven,
Moses loved God and
 prayed to Him every day.@@@

One night angels
 talked to Moses.
They told him God wanted
 him to help the Israelite people.
Someday Moses would help
 the people to be free.
They would not
 be slaves any more.@@@

Moses was a
 good soldier now.
He thought maybe God wanted him
 to fight to save the people.
He went to
 visit the Israelites.
He felt sad when he
 saw the slave masters hurting them.@@@

One day Moses saw a slave
 master hit an Israelite slave very hard.
Moses got angry.
He killed the slave master.
But that was not the
 way God wanted him to help.@@@

Somebody told the king
 what Moses had done.@@@

King Pharaoh was angry.
Moses was afraid and
 ran away from the palace.
He ran away from Egypt.
He felt sad.
He thought that now God could
 not use him to help the people.
He knew it was wrong
 to kill the slave master.
He prayed,
“Oh,
God,
please forgive me.
” God heard his prayer.
He cared for Moses
 as he ran away.@@@

Moses ran far
 away from Egypt.
He came to
 a place called Midian.
He was very tired,
so he sat down
 to rest by a well.@@@

Soon he saw seven young
 ladies coming to the well.
They were bringing sheep to
 the well to drink water.
Soon other shepherds came.
They pushed the girls away and started
 to get water for their own sheep.@@@

“Stop!” Moses told the shepherds.
“The ladies were here first.
” Then Moses helped the
 girls give water to the sheep.@@@

The girls said,
“Thank you,
” to Moses.
Then they went
 home with their sheep.@@@

Their father,
Jethro,
said,@@@

When the girls told
 their father about Moses,
he sent them
 back to the well.
He said,
“Tell that nice man to
 come and eat with us.@@@

Moses came to
 eat at Jethro’s house.
He slept there,
too.
Then he stayed at Jethro’s
 house for a long time.
He took care
 of Jethro’s sheep.
He was a shepherd.@@@

While Moses was taking
 care of the sheep,
he prayed to God.
God was his teacher.
He learned to
 be kind and patient.
He didn’t want to
 be a soldier any more.@@@

Moses married one
 of Jethro’s daughters.
Her name was Zipporah.
They had two sons.
They were happy living
 in the land of Midian.
