<break time="0.5s"/>Noah’s family was<break time="2s"/> safe inside the ark.<break time="2s"/>
For forty days and<break time="2s"/> nights the rain poured down.<break time="2s"/>
It came harder and harder—faster<break time="2s"/> and faster! The water got deeper.<break time="2s"/>
Noah felt the big boat<break time="2s"/> lift as it began to float.<break time="2s"/>
The water covered<break time="2s"/> even the highest mountain.<break time="2s"/>

At last the rain stopped.<break time="1.8s"/>
Big waves rocked the<break time="2s"/> ark back and forth.<break time="2s"/>
Days and weeks<break time="2s"/> and months went by.<break time="2s"/>
Little by little the<break time="2s"/> flood waters went down.<break time="2s"/>
God sent angels to guide the boat<break time="2s"/> to a place between some high mountains.<break time="2s"/>
The water was quieter there.<break time="1.8s"/>
