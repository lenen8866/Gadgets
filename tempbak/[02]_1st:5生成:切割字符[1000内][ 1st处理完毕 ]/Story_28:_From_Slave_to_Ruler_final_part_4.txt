Pharaoh felt better now.<break time="1.3s"/>
This young man<break time="2s"/> knew what to do.<break time="2s"/>
The king and his helpers chose Joseph<break time="2s"/> to be the one to store up food.<break time="2s"/>

I am making you<break time="2s"/> the governor of Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
” the king told Joseph.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Only I,<break time="1s"/>
Pharaoh,<break time="0.5s"/>
will be higher than you.<break time="1.8s"/>
You will be the one to keep the<break time="2s"/> people of Egypt from starving when the famine comes.<break time="2s"/>

Had he heard Pharaoh right? He<break time="2s"/> was not a slave any more.<break time="2s"/>
He did not have<break time="2s"/> to go back to prison.<break time="2s"/>
