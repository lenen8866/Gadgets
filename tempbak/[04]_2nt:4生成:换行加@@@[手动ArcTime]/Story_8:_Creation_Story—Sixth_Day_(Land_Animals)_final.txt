On the sixth
 day God spoke again.
"Let the earth bring
 forth the living creature.
" And there
 they wereâ€”land animals.@@@

There were giraffes
 with long necks.
There were turtles with
 hard shells on their backs.
There were hopping
 kangaroos and woolly lambs.@@@

Dogs barked and cows mooed.@@@

God liked the
 animals He had made.
He knew that the people He
 was going to create would like them,
too.@@@

God was nearly
 finished making the world.
He was going to create the
 most important thing last of all.
