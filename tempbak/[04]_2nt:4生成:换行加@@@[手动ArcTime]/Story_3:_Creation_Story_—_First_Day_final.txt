Pretend that you are holding a
 ball of nothing in your hand.
Now take this ball of
 nothing and make a beautiful rose.
Make it smell very nice.
Give it green leaves.
Then make it grow.
Can you do that?
 Of course you cannot.
Only God can create
 something out of nothing.@@@

Long ago God decided
 to make a new world.
That new world was
 our earth where we live.
In the beginning the
 earth had no shape.
Darkness covered the deep water.
There was no light.
No sun or moon
 or stars could be seen.
Then God spoke,
"Let there be light.
" Then there was light.
God used His great power
 to make the light to shine.@@@

Right then,
everything on this
 earth got started.
The day passed.
The evening came.
It was the first day.
God liked the light
 that He had made.@@@

When God made light,
the colors were made,
too.
When there is no light,
there is no color.
