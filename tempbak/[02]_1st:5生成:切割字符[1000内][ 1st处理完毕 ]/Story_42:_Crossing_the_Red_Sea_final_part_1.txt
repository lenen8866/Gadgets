<break time="0.5s"/>It was still night when God<break time="2s"/> told Moses it was time to go.<break time="2s"/>
Moses told the<break time="2s"/> people to get ready.<break time="2s"/>
They packed up<break time="2s"/> their things again.<break time="2s"/>
All the people and<break time="2s"/> animals got into line.<break time="2s"/>
But where could they go? The<break time="2s"/> sea was in front of them.<break time="2s"/>
The mountains were<break time="2s"/> on both sides.<break time="2s"/>
Pharaoh and his<break time="2s"/> army were behind them.<break time="2s"/>

God told Moses,<break time="1s"/>
“Lift up your rod and<break time="2s"/> put it out over the water.<break time="2s"/>
” Moses obeyed.<break time="1s"/>
Right then a<break time="2s"/> wind began to blow.<break time="2s"/>
It blew very hard.<break time="1.3s"/>
The water in the<break time="2s"/> Red Sea began to divide.<break time="2s"/>
