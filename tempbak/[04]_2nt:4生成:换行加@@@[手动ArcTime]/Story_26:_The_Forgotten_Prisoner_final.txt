“Why would God let this
 happen to me?” Joseph wondered.
The chains hurt his feet,
and prison was not
 a nice place to be.
But Joseph knew that God
 was with him even here.
He would be the
 best prisoner in this prison.@@@

The keeper of the prison saw
 how good and kind Joseph was.
He took all
 the chains off.@@@

The keeper gave
 Joseph work to do.
Joseph was glad to help.
Soon he asked Joseph to
 take care of all the prisoners.
God was with
 Joseph and helped him.@@@

Joseph was kind
 to the prisoners.
He told them
 of God’s love.
It made them feel better.@@@

One day two new men
 were put into the prison.
They came from Pharaoh’s palace.
They were two
 of Pharaoh’s workers.
One of them,
the butler,
took care of
 the king’s drinks.
The other one,
the baker,
baked bread and cakes
 for Pharaoh and his family.
Joseph liked to
 talk to these men.
They told him news
 of things happening in Egypt.@@@

One morning Joseph saw that
 the two new prisoners looked sad.
“Why are you
 sad?” he asked.@@@

“We have each
 had a dream,
” they said.
“We don’t know
 what our dreams mean.@@@

Dreams! Joseph thought
 of his two dreams.
“My God,
the God of heaven,
can give the
 meanings of dreams,
” Joseph said.
“Tell me your dreams.@@@

The butler said,
“In my dream I saw
 a grapevine with three branches.
There were grapes
 on the branches.
I picked the grapes and
 squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup.
Then I gave the juice
 to the king to drink.
” The butler looked
 at Joseph for an answer.@@@

God helped Joseph tell
 the meaning of the dream.
“In three days Pharaoh will take you
 back into the palace to work for him,
” Joseph said.@@@

“When you are
 in the palace again,
think of me,
” said Joseph.
“Please talk to
 Pharaoh about me.
I was put into prison
 for something I didn’t do.@@@

“I will remember,
” said the butler.@@@

Now it was
 the baker’s turn.
He told his dream.
“I had three
 baskets on my head,
” he said.
“There were cakes for
 Pharaoh in the top basket.
Birds came and ate
 the cakes from the basket.@@@

Joseph felt sad when he told
 the baker what his dream meant.
“In three days you will
 be called back to the palace,
too,
” Joseph told the baker.
“But the king will not
 take you back to work.@@@

Three days later,
the two dreams came true.
It happened just as
 Joseph said it would.
But the butler
 forgot about Joseph.
