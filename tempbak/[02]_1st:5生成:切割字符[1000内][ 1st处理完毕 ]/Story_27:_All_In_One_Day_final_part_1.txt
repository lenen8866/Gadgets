Pharaoh,<break time="0.5s"/>
the king of Egypt,<break time="1.3s"/>
could not sleep.<break time="1s"/>
He kept thinking of the<break time="2s"/> dreams he had just had.<break time="2s"/>
What strange dreams! What could<break time="2s"/> they mean? He couldn’t sleep.<break time="2s"/>
Better get up.<break time="1s"/>
He would call his<break time="2s"/> wise men to the palace.<break time="2s"/>
They would tell him<break time="2s"/> what these dreams meant.<break time="2s"/>

“Bring all my wise men,<break time="1.8s"/>
” he told his servants.<break time="1.8s"/>
Horses galloped through the streets bringing<break time="2s"/> these important men to the palace.<break time="2s"/>

Soon Pharaoh was<break time="2s"/> in his throne room.<break time="2s"/>
His sleepy wise<break time="2s"/> men were there.<break time="2s"/>
