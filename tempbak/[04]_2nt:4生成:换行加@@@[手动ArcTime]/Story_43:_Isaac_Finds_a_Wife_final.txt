God had given Abraham and Sarah
 a son when they were old.
How they loved Isaac.
What a happy home they had as he grew up to
 be a man! He was obedient and loved the God of heaven.
After Sarah died,
Abraham called Eliezer,
his servant,
to him.
“Eliezer,
” he said,
“I am getting old and Isaac
 needs a wife to be with him.
I want you
 to go to Haran,
where my brother’s family lives,
to find a
 wife for Isaac.
God will send his angel before
 you to help you find her.
” Eliezer took ten camels with gifts for
 the girl God would choose and for her family.@@@

The trip took
 days of travelling.
At last Eliezer got to Haran and stopped
 to rest his camels at the village well.
It was evening,
and the women were coming
 to fill their pitchers with water.
Eliezer didn’t know anyone.
He started talking to
 God in his heart.@@@

“Please,
God,
help me to find
 the right wife for Isaac.
Let it be that when I ask
 the right woman to give me a drink,
she will answer,
‘Yes,
and I’ll give
 water to your camels,
too.@@@

While Eliezer was still praying,
a lovely young woman
 came to the well.
She filled her
 pitcher with water.
Then Eliezer asked
 her for a drink.
“Yes,
” she said,
“and I’ll give
 water to your camels,
too.@@@

“How quickly God has answered
 my prayer!” Eliezer was thinking.@@@

The young woman said
 that her name was Rebekah.
She told Eliezer that
 Abraham’s brother was her grandfather.
“And there is room at
 our house for you to stay,
” she said.@@@

Everyone in Rebekah’s family was
 excited to hear all about Abraham,
Sarah,
and Isaac.
Eliezer told about why he had come to
 Haran and about his prayer at the well.
Rebekah’s eyes shone
 as she listened.@@@

The parents said,
“This is from God.
” When they asked Rebekah if
 she would go to be Isaac’s wife,
she said that she would.@@@

Eliezer wanted to begin the
 trip back to Canaan very soon.
Abraham and Isaac
 would be waiting.
So everyone was busy helping
 Rebekah get ready to go.@@@

It was hard for Rebekah
 to say good-bye to her family,
but she knew God wanted
 her to be Isaac’s wife.@@@

On the long
 trip to Isaac’s home,
Rebekah had many
 questions for Eliezer.
He told her about Abraham
 and Isaac and their home.@@@

At last they could
 see Abraham’s tents far away.
Then they saw Isaac
 coming to meet them.@@@

There was a
 big wedding feast.
It was a happy
 day in Abraham’s home.
Isaac loved his
 beautiful wife very much.
She helped to
 make him happy.
Abraham was happy too.
