Joseph’s brothers watched until they couldn’t
 see the caravan of camels any more.
Joseph was gone.
Only his beautiful
 coat was left.
They didn’t care if Joseph was sad or if
 he would have to work hard as a slave.@@@

Reuben was away
 when they sold Joseph.
When he came back,
he went to the well.
Joseph was not there.
Reuben came running
 to the brothers.
“The child is gone! How can I
 tell Father? What shall I do?” he cried.@@@

“Joseph is still alive,
” the brothers said.
“We sold him
 as a slave.
It will be good for
 him to learn to work.
” They laughed as
 they talked about Joseph’s dreams.@@@

Reuben was unhappy.
Father had put him in
 charge as he was the oldest.
He had planned to
 take Joseph from the well,
but now his
 plans could not work.
He could not think of
 a way to rescue Joseph.
They would have to tell lies to their father so
 he would not know what they had done to Joseph.@@@

The brothers tried to think of
 what they would tell their father.
He must not know
 that they had sold Joseph.@@@

First,
they tore Joseph’s coat and put
 some blood from an animal on it.
They wanted it to look like
 a wild animal had killed him.@@@

In a few days they got all the cows
 and sheep and goats together and started for home.@@@

The first thing Jacob said
 when he saw the brothers was,@@@

“Joseph? Isn’t he with
 you?” the brothers asked.@@@

“No! no!” said Jacob,
“I sent him
 to find you.@@@

Then the brothers
 acted sad and worried.
Slowly they brought out the torn
 coat with blood stains on it.
“We found this
 in a field,
” they said,
as they gave
 Joseph’s coat to Jacob.
“Could it be Joseph’s coat?
 It looks something like it.@@@

“It is my son’s
 coat!” Jacob cried out.
“It is the
 one I gave him.
A wild animal
 has killed him.@@@

Poor Jacob! For days
 and weeks he was sad.
His sons and daughter
 tried to comfort him,
but they could not.
His dear son,
Joseph,@@@

The brothers felt sorry when they
 saw how sad their father was.
But they did not tell
 anyone what they had done.
They thought their
 father would never know.
But they had
 forgotten one thing.
They had forgotten God.
God had a
 plan for Joseph’s life.
He would be with Joseph and
 care of him wherever he went.@@@

When you are afraid,
remember Joseph.
God will be with
 you and care for you,
too,
if you ask Him.
Talk to Him right now.
