Joseph ran the last little<break time="2s"/> way to his brothers’ tents.<break time="2s"/>
He waved happily,<break time="1s"/>
but the brothers<break time="2s"/> did not wave back.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph looked from one<break time="2s"/> brother to the other.<break time="2s"/>
There were no<break time="2s"/> smiles of welcome.<break time="2s"/>
His brothers’ faces<break time="2s"/> looked angry and mean.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was afraid.<break time="1s"/>

They grabbed him.<break time="1s"/>
They tore off<break time="2s"/> his beautiful coat.<break time="2s"/>
Then they pulled him<break time="2s"/> to the old well.<break time="2s"/>

“I brought you<break time="2s"/> food from father,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“Father sent me to you.<break time="1.8s"/>
Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
please don’t hurt me.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Now we’ll see what<break time="2s"/> happens to those dreams,<break time="2s"/>
