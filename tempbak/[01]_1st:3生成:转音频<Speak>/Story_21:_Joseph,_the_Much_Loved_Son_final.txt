<break time="0.5s"/>Jacob had a big family.<break time="1.8s"/>
There were eleven<break time="2s"/> boys and one girl.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was the youngest.<break time="1.3s"/>
They knew there would<break time="2s"/> be a new baby soon.<break time="2s"/>
That made Joseph<break time="2s"/> feel very happy.<break time="2s"/>
He would have<break time="2s"/> someone to play with.<break time="2s"/>
Sometimes his older brothers<break time="2s"/> were not kind to him.<break time="2s"/>
The family was travelling.<break time="1.3s"/>
They were soon going<break time="2s"/> to see Grandfather Isaac.<break time="2s"/>
They would live near him.<break time="1.8s"/>
That’s where Father Jacob had lived<break time="2s"/> when he was a little boy.<break time="2s"/>

First,<break time="0.5s"/>
it was time to stop<break time="2s"/> at Bethel for a few days.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was very happy<break time="2s"/> to be at Bethel.<break time="2s"/>
He held his father’s hand as they<break time="2s"/> walked around looking for a special place.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was excited.<break time="1s"/>
“Where was it,<break time="1s"/>

“I think it<break time="2s"/> was right about here,<break time="2s"/>
son.<break time="0.5s"/>
” Jacob’s eyes were shining.<break time="1.8s"/>
“The rock was<break time="2s"/> a very hard pillow.<break time="2s"/>
But I’ll never<break time="2s"/> forget the dream.<break time="2s"/>
The angels were so beautiful.<break time="1.8s"/>
God was right<break time="2s"/> here with me.<break time="2s"/>

“Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
Father,<break time="0.5s"/>
I wish God would give<break time="2s"/> me a dream like that,<break time="2s"/>
” Joseph said.<break time="1s"/>

“Keep loving God,<break time="1s"/>
Joseph,<break time="0.5s"/>
” answered Father.<break time="1s"/>
“Keep praying every day.<break time="1.3s"/>

Soon it was<break time="2s"/> time to leave Bethel.<break time="2s"/>
It would not be much<break time="2s"/> farther to Grandfather Isaac’s home.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph could hardly wait.<break time="1.3s"/>
He had never<break time="2s"/> seen his grandfather.<break time="2s"/>
There were special stories<break time="2s"/> he wanted to hear.<break time="2s"/>
He had heard the stories<break time="2s"/> many times from his father,<break time="2s"/>
but he wanted to<break time="2s"/> hear them from Grandfather himself.<break time="2s"/>

Grandfather Isaac was blind.<break time="1.3s"/>
How happy he was to have his family living<break time="2s"/> near him! Joseph loved to go to Grandfather’s tent.<break time="2s"/>
He listened to his<break time="2s"/> stories over and over again.<break time="2s"/>
The best stories were about when<break time="2s"/> God talked to Abraham and Isaac.<break time="2s"/>

“Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
I wish God would talk<break time="2s"/> to me!” Joseph jumped up,<break time="2s"/>
kissed Grandfather Isaac and ran<break time="2s"/> home to his own tent.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph was busy every<break time="2s"/> day at his new home.<break time="2s"/>
The family had<break time="2s"/> many sheep and goats.<break time="2s"/>
The animals needed<break time="2s"/> grass to eat.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph and his brothers had to<break time="2s"/> find places where there was grass.<break time="2s"/>
Then they had to<break time="2s"/> care for the animals.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph played with<break time="2s"/> his new little brother,<break time="2s"/>
Benjamin,<break time="0.5s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
He missed his<break time="2s"/> mother very much.<break time="2s"/>
She had died when<break time="2s"/> Baby Benjamin was born.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob and Joseph often<break time="2s"/> talked about Mother Rachel.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph loved the little lambs.<break time="1.8s"/>
He was very<break time="2s"/> kind to them.<break time="2s"/>
But his brothers<break time="2s"/> were not kind.<break time="2s"/>
And they were not careful.<break time="1.8s"/>
If a lamb got lost,<break time="1.8s"/>
they did not care.<break time="1.3s"/>
This made Joseph sad.<break time="1.3s"/>
He told his<break time="2s"/> father about it.<break time="2s"/>
That made the<break time="2s"/> brothers angry at Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob loved Joseph the<break time="2s"/> best of all his sons.<break time="2s"/>
He made a<break time="2s"/> special coat for Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
It was the kind of<break time="2s"/> coat that kings and princes wear.<break time="2s"/>
It was a coat<break time="2s"/> with many pretty colors.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob gave the<break time="2s"/> coat to Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
How happy he was! He<break time="2s"/> liked to feel the soft cloth.<break time="2s"/>
The bright colors<break time="2s"/> made him feel good.<break time="2s"/>
Benjamin liked the coat,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
He smiled as<break time="2s"/> he touched the coat.<break time="2s"/>

However,<break time="0.5s"/>
the other brothers<break time="2s"/> were not happy.<break time="2s"/>
“Why should Joseph wear the<break time="2s"/> coat of a prince?” they asked.<break time="2s"/>
The brothers were<break time="2s"/> jealous of Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
