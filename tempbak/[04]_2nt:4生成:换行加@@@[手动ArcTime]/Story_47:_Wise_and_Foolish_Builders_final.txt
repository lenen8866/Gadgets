Jesus told many stories to help
 people understand how to be God’s children.
One of these stories
 was about building houses.@@@

Long ago a very wise
 man decided to build a house.
He searched here and there looking
 for the best place to build.
At last he
 found a good place.@@@

“I’ve found the spot on
 which I shall build my house,
” he told his friend.@@@

“Where?” his friend
 wanted to know.@@@

“On the hill up there.
” he pointed.@@@

“Why so far
 away?” his friend asked.
“Why don’t you build beside me here
 on the sand? It would be much easier.@@@

The wise man
 shook his head.
“You see,
I want the house that I build
 to last as long as I live,
and as long as my
 children and my grandchildren live.@@@

“You’re in for a
 lot of hard work,
” his friend said.@@@

Up on the hill,
the wise man began
 to build his house.
He worked from morning
 until night every day.
First he took
 away the stones.
His back ached.
His arms and
 hands were sore.
He didn’t mind the pain.
“My house must be
 built on solid rock,
” he said.@@@

Down in the valley his
 friend was building a house too.
It was easy to dig
 the foundation in the sand.
He laughed at the man on
 the hill who was working so hard.@@@

Since the wise man wanted
 to build the best house possible,
he laid the foundation
 on the solid rock.
He looked for the
 best stones he could find.
The strong walls
 began to rise,
stone upon stone.
At last his
 house was finished.
It stood on
 a strong foundation,
firm,
straight and beautiful.@@@

The storms came.
Rain poured down.
Little streams of water became a flooded river that
 rushed down the valley and in to the lake.
The house in the valley which had been built
 so quickly and carelessly fell down and was washed away.
But the stone house
 on the rock stood firm.@@@

Then Jesus said,
“Everyone who comes to Me,
and obeys Me is like the wise
 man who built his house on the rock.
Even when storms and
 wind and rain come,
the house is safe.@@@

“People who hear what I tell
 them but do not obey Me,
are like the foolish man who
 built his house on the sand.
When the storm came,
it fell with
 a terrible crash.@@@

The story was finished.
The people started down
 the road towards home.
Ever after,
when they looked at houses,
they remembered the story
 of the two houses,
and they understood
 what Jesus meant.
