Shh! Don’t tell
 anyone! It’s a secret.
Did you ever have a secret? Miriam
 was a little girl who had a secret.
She was twelve years old and lived
 in a little mud-brick house in Egypt.
Her father,
Amram,
knew the secret.
Her mother,
Jochabed,
knew the secret too.
Even her little brother,
Aaron,
knew about it.
The secret was
 a happy one.
There was a new baby brother in
 their house! The baby’s name was Moses.
But the secret
 made the family afraid.@@@

A new Pharaoh was
 the king of Egypt.
He did not
 like the Israelite people.
He made them his slaves.
Father Amram had to
 work very hard for Pharaoh.
Sometimes the king’s helpers
 would beat the slaves.@@@

Pharaoh thought there
 were too many Israelites.
He made a very
 sad and scary rule.
All the baby boys were to
 be thrown into the River Nile.
That is why the new
 baby must be a secret.
If Pharaoh and his men
 would find out about the baby,
they would take him away.@@@

Moses grew bigger and bigger.
He was big enough
 to make happy baby sounds.
He was big
 enough to cry loudly.
Whenever an Egyptian
 guard passed the house,
the family was afraid.
They tried to
 keep the baby quiet.@@@

One morning Mother Jochabed said,
“We cannot hide
 our secret much longer.
Someone will hear Moses crying and will
 know there is a baby in our house.
” The family did
 not know what to do.@@@

Father Amram said,
“We will pray to God.
He will help us.@@@

The family prayed together.
“Dear God,
” said Father,
“please help us to know what
 to do to save our baby.@@@

God had a plan
 for the little baby.
He helped Mother Jochabed
 think of the plan.
The River Nile was
 not far from the village.
Some tall reeds grew on
 the banks of the river.
Mother took some of the
 reeds and wove a basket.
Miriam helped put pitch on
 the outside of the basket.@@@

“The pitch will
 keep the water out,
” Mother told Miriam.
“We will put
 Moses in the basket.
We will put the
 basket in the river.
You will hide in
 the reeds to watch him.@@@

“But,
Mother,
” Miriam began to cry.
“I’m afraid something bad will
 happen to my little brother.@@@

Mother hugged Miriam.
“We must do our
 best to save Moses,
” she said,
“God loves him too.
He will send angels
 to watch over him.
