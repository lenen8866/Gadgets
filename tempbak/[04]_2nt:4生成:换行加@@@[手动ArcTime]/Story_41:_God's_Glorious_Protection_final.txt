The people walked
 for two days.
They were tired,
but they were free.
And they were happy.@@@

Night was coming again.
It was time
 to stop walking.
It was time to rest.
Fathers put up tents.
Mothers cooked food.
The people were
 ready to sleep.
The sun went down.
It was getting dark.
It was getting cold,
too.@@@

Then something wonderful happened.
Everyone stopped what
 they were doing.
They looked up
 into the sky.
There was a long
 cloud like a pillar.
As the sky got darker,
the cloud got brighter.
Soon it was
 a pillar of fire.
There was light
 in the camp.
It was not cold
 and not dark anymore.@@@

“What is it?”
 the people asked.@@@

Moses knew.
He told the people,
“God has put
 the cloud there.
He will take
 care of us.
He is our leader.
We will follow the cloud.@@@

The next day the
 cloud started to move.
The cloud gave shade from
 the desert sun in the daytime.
Everyone packed up their tents
 and food and followed the cloud.
It led them on
 and on until night came.
They stopped when
 the cloud stopped.@@@

The people put up their tents
 in a valley between two mountains.
The Red Sea was
 in front of them.
The people were
 hungry and tired.
But what was that noise? Hundreds
 of chariots and soldiers were coming.
They were coming
 closer and closer.@@@

After the Israelites
 had left Egypt,
Pharaoh and his men were sorry
 they had let the people go.
Pharaoh needed help to
 make bricks for his buildings.
He decided to bring
 the people back to Egypt.
He took his chariots and soldiers
 and went after the people of Israel.
He and his army hurried very fast
 and found the camp by the sea.@@@

“The Israelites are trapped,
” Pharaoh said.
“They have no
 place to go.
They will have to
 come back with us.
This will be easy.@@@

But when Pharaoh and his soldiers
 got very close to the Israelite's camp,
they had to stop.
It was dark,
and there was fog too.
The army would have
 to wait till morning light.@@@

It was not dark
 in the camp of Israel.
The pillar of fire made
 the camp bright on their side.@@@

When the people prayed
 to God for help,
some of them were afraid.
Some of them
 were angry at Moses.
“Why did you bring
 us here?” they asked.
“It was better to
 be slaves in Egypt.@@@

Moses was sorry that the
 people did not trust God.
He told them
 not to be afraid.
He said,
“Stand still.
God will take
 care of us.
