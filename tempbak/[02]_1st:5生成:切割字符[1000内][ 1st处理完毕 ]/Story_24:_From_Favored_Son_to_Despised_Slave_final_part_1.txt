down into the well.<break time="1.3s"/>
There was no<break time="2s"/> water in this well,<break time="2s"/>
but it was deep.<break time="1.3s"/>

After the brothers pushed<break time="2s"/> Joseph into the well,<break time="2s"/>
they heard him crying and<break time="2s"/> begging them to take him out.<break time="2s"/>
But they just went away and<break time="2s"/> sat down to eat their lunch.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was hungry,<break time="1s"/>
but they didn’t<break time="2s"/> give him any food.<break time="2s"/>

Down in the<break time="2s"/> valley below them,<break time="2s"/>
they saw a long line of<break time="2s"/> camels walking along the dusty road.<break time="2s"/>
“I think the men on those camels are<break time="2s"/> going to Egypt to sell spices and slaves,<break time="2s"/>
” said one brother.<break time="1.3s"/>

Judah jumped up.<break time="1s"/>
