<break time="0.5s"/>Godâ€™s plan was to create<break time="2s"/> people to live on the earth.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to be His friends.<break time="2s"/>
But first God would create<break time="2s"/> a beautiful world for their home.<break time="2s"/>
He would give<break time="2s"/> them everything they needed.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to be very happy.<break time="2s"/>
On the first<break time="2s"/> day He made light.<break time="2s"/>
People would not be able to<break time="2s"/> see if they did not have light.<break time="2s"/>
On the second day,<break time="1.3s"/>
He created something else for<break time="2s"/> the people He would make.<break time="2s"/>

God spoke,<break time="1s"/>
"Let the waters rise to<break time="2s"/> make a big space of sky.<break time="2s"/>
" Some water went up.<break time="1.8s"/>
This water made the clouds.<break time="1.8s"/>
He filled the<break time="2s"/> space with air.<break time="2s"/>
People would need<break time="2s"/> air to live.<break time="2s"/>
God planned to make plants<break time="2s"/> and animals for the people.<break time="2s"/>
These would need<break time="2s"/> air to live,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
That is why God created<break time="2s"/> air on the second day.<break time="2s"/>

Evening came.<break time="1s"/>
The second day was done.<break time="1.8s"/>
God looked at the<break time="2s"/> big space filled with air.<break time="2s"/>
He saw that<break time="2s"/> it was very good.<break time="2s"/>
God liked what<break time="2s"/> He had made.<break time="2s"/>
He knew the people He<break time="2s"/> would create would like it,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
