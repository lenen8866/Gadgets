<break time="0.5s"/>Many people came to<break time="2s"/> see what Noah was doing.<break time="2s"/>
He told them that water<break time="2s"/> would fall from the sky.<break time="2s"/>
So much rain would fall that the whole<break time="2s"/> earth would be covered by a flood of water.<break time="2s"/>

“Rain! What’s rain?”<break time="2s"/> the people asked.<break time="2s"/>
No one had<break time="2s"/> ever seen rain.<break time="2s"/>
Since the creation of the<break time="2s"/> earth hundreds of years before,<break time="2s"/>
God had watered<break time="2s"/> the earth with dew.<break time="2s"/>
But Noah knew<break time="2s"/> rain would come.<break time="2s"/>
God had said it would.<break time="1.8s"/>

There was much<break time="2s"/> work to be done.<break time="2s"/>
It would take many<break time="2s"/> years to finish the ark.<break time="2s"/>
Inside,<break time="0.5s"/>
cages and rooms<break time="2s"/> must be built.<break time="2s"/>
Food would have to be taken into<break time="2s"/> the ark for the people and animals.<break time="2s"/>

At first,<break time="1s"/>
Noah’s preaching made<break time="2s"/> the people afraid.<break time="2s"/>
They watched the<break time="2s"/> sky for rain.<break time="2s"/>
Days and weeks<break time="2s"/> and years went by.<break time="2s"/>
Still it did not rain.<break time="1.8s"/>
People began to<break time="2s"/> make fun of Noah,<break time="2s"/>
but that didn’t stop him.<break time="1.8s"/>
He was too<break time="2s"/> busy obeying God.<break time="2s"/>

There were people who<break time="2s"/> helped Noah build the ark.<break time="2s"/>
His father and<break time="2s"/> his brothers helped.<break time="2s"/>
His three young sons,<break time="1.3s"/>
Shem,<break time="0.5s"/>
Ham,<break time="0.5s"/>
and Japheth helped,<break time="1s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
During the many<break time="2s"/> years of ark-building,<break time="2s"/>
Noah’s sons grew<break time="2s"/> up and got married.<break time="2s"/>

After one hundred and<break time="2s"/> twenty years of work,<break time="2s"/>
the ark was finished.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was so big people<break time="2s"/> could see it from far away.<break time="2s"/>
Noah had done what<break time="2s"/> God had told him.<break time="2s"/>

Noah had preached to the people about the<break time="2s"/> flood all the years he was building the ark.<break time="2s"/>
Now he said,<break time="1s"/>
“Please come in.<break time="1s"/>
The door is still open.<break time="1.8s"/>
” Some people thought<break time="2s"/> they should go in,<break time="2s"/>
but they were afraid their<break time="2s"/> friends would laugh at them.<break time="2s"/>
So they joined in<break time="2s"/> making fun of Noah.<break time="2s"/>

“Noah is a<break time="2s"/> crazy old man,<break time="2s"/>
” the people were saying.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
he thinks this heavy<break time="2s"/> boat will float on water.<break time="2s"/>

Suddenly the joking<break time="2s"/> and fun stopped.<break time="2s"/>
People looked toward<break time="2s"/> the hills and forests.<break time="2s"/>
Animals were coming.<break time="1s"/>
Farm animals were coming.<break time="1.3s"/>
Wild animals were coming,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

The animals walked<break time="2s"/> to the ark.<break time="2s"/>
Then up the ramp they went and<break time="2s"/> into the ark through the big door.<break time="2s"/>
The wild animals and the<break time="2s"/> tame animals walked side by side.<break time="2s"/>
Male and female animals came.<break time="1.8s"/>
Two of some animals<break time="2s"/> came and seven of others.<break time="2s"/>
They did not<break time="2s"/> crowd or push.<break time="2s"/>
Angels were leading them,<break time="1.3s"/>
but the people could<break time="2s"/> not see the angels.<break time="2s"/>

The news about the<break time="2s"/> animals was heard everywhere.<break time="2s"/>
People came to<break time="2s"/> see the strange sight.<break time="2s"/>
For one week the<break time="2s"/> animals walked into the ark.<break time="2s"/>
Then one day the sky was<break time="2s"/> filled with all kinds of birds—birds flying,<break time="2s"/>
flying,<break time="0.5s"/>
into the ark.<break time="1s"/>
Angels were leading them too.<break time="1.8s"/>
