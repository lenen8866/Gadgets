Potiphar trusted Joseph<break time="2s"/> more and more.<break time="2s"/>
After awhile he had to<break time="2s"/> take care of everything Potiphar had.<break time="2s"/>
God blessed Potiphar’s house<break time="2s"/> and fields because of Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
Potiphar loved Joseph<break time="2s"/> like his own son.<break time="2s"/>

Then a sad<break time="2s"/> thing happened to Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
Potiphar’s wife told<break time="2s"/> a lie about him.<break time="2s"/>
Potiphar put Joseph in prison.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph had been<break time="2s"/> a faithful worker.<break time="2s"/>
Now he was in prison<break time="2s"/> for something he didn’t do.<break time="2s"/>
Still Joseph trusted<break time="2s"/> God to help him.<break time="2s"/>

He would be the<break time="2s"/> best prisoner he could be.<break time="2s"/>
