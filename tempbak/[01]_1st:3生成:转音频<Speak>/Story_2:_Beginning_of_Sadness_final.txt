<break time="0.5s"/>God made a<break time="2s"/> special angel named Lucifer.<break time="2s"/>
He was very beautiful.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was a leader of<break time="2s"/> the other angels in heaven.<break time="2s"/>
He led the choir.<break time="1.3s"/>
All the angels loved Lucifer.<break time="1.8s"/>

Little by little,<break time="1s"/>
Lucifer began to think<break time="2s"/> about how special he was.<break time="2s"/>
"I am the most beautiful<break time="2s"/> and the wisest angel of all,<break time="2s"/>
" he said.<break time="1s"/>

God the Father and God<break time="2s"/> the Son had a meeting.<break time="2s"/>
"Why didnâ€™t they invite me<break time="2s"/> to the meeting?" Lucifer thought.<break time="2s"/>
"I am a<break time="2s"/> very special angel.<break time="2s"/>
" Lucifer was jealous<break time="2s"/> of God the Son.<break time="2s"/>

Then Lucifer started to<break time="2s"/> talk to the other angels.<break time="2s"/>
"God is not fair,<break time="1.3s"/>
" he said.<break time="1s"/>
"He likes the<break time="2s"/> Son better than me.<break time="2s"/>
" The angels were surprised.<break time="1.8s"/>
They loved God.<break time="1s"/>
But slowly,<break time="1s"/>
some of the<break time="2s"/> angels believed Lucifer.<break time="2s"/>

God the Father and<break time="2s"/> the Son talked with Lucifer.<break time="2s"/>
They tried to help him.<break time="1.8s"/>
But Lucifer wanted<break time="2s"/> to be like God.<break time="2s"/>
A being God had made<break time="2s"/> could not be like Him.<break time="2s"/>

At last,<break time="1s"/>
God had to send<break time="2s"/> Lucifer out of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
Many of the<break time="2s"/> angels went with him.<break time="2s"/>
It was a very<break time="2s"/> sad time in heaven.<break time="2s"/>

Now Lucifer chose to be<break time="2s"/> an angel of lies and hate.<break time="2s"/>
He was called Satan.<break time="1.3s"/>
He wanted to do<break time="2s"/> everything he could against God.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted angels and people<break time="2s"/> to be on his side.<break time="2s"/>
He wants you to<break time="2s"/> be on his side,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
We should not<break time="2s"/> listen to Satan.<break time="2s"/>
