<break time="0.5s"/>One night Joseph<break time="2s"/> had a strange dream.<break time="2s"/>
He woke up in<break time="2s"/> the morning thinking about it.<break time="2s"/>
He did not know that an<break time="2s"/> angel had given him the dream.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph told his<break time="2s"/> brothers about it.<break time="2s"/>
“Listen to my dream,<break time="1.3s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“It’s about you! I dreamed<break time="2s"/> we were working in the field.<break time="2s"/>
We were tying<break time="2s"/> the grain into bundles.<break time="2s"/>

“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
what?” the brothers asked.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Well,<break time="0.5s"/>
suddenly my bundle stood straight up! Then all<break time="2s"/> your bundles stood up and bowed to mine.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers were angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
They all began<break time="2s"/> to talk at once.<break time="2s"/>
“Who do you think<break time="2s"/> you are?” they asked.<break time="2s"/>
“Do you think you’ll be a king? We won’t bow<break time="2s"/> down to you!” Joseph knew they did not like him.<break time="2s"/>

Then a few nights later the angel<break time="2s"/> came back with another dream for Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
He wondered if he should<break time="2s"/> tell this dream to his brothers.<break time="2s"/>
The dream was so real.<break time="1.8s"/>
So he told his<break time="2s"/> father and his brothers,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

“I dreamed another dream,<break time="1.3s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“This time,<break time="1s"/>
the sun and moon and eleven<break time="2s"/> stars were bowing down to me.<break time="2s"/>

Father Jacob said,<break time="1s"/>
“What is this dream?<break time="2s"/> Are you saying that we,<break time="2s"/>
your brothers and I,<break time="1.3s"/>
will bow down to you?” The brothers looked<break time="2s"/> very angry and said things that were not kind.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph didn’t say any more.<break time="1.8s"/>
But he wondered if God was<break time="2s"/> telling him something in his dreams.<break time="2s"/>
