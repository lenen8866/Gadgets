It was still night when God
 told Moses it was time to go.
Moses told the
 people to get ready.
They packed up
 their things again.
All the people and
 animals got into line.
But where could they go? The
 sea was in front of them.
The mountains were
 on both sides.
Pharaoh and his
 army were behind them.@@@

God told Moses,
“Lift up your rod and
 put it out over the water.
” Moses obeyed.
Right then a
 wind began to blow.
It blew very hard.
The water in the
 Red Sea began to divide.
It piled up higher
 and higher on each side.
The light from the cloud
 of fire shone on the waves.
There was a road
 between the walls of water.
You could not see the end of
 the long road through the Red Sea.@@@

“Go forward,
” Moses shouted.
The people and
 animals started to walk.
Right down to the path
 through the sea they went.
Children looked with wonder at
 the high walls of water.
The great God
 of heaven loved them.
He was saving them
 from Pharaoh and his army.
On and on they marched.
They kept going until
 they reached the other side.
When the last person
 went down the path,
the cloud of
 fire followed slowly.@@@

While the Israelites were walking,
Pharaoh and his
 soldiers were sleeping,
but the guards were awake.
They heard tramping feet.
What was happening? There was no
 place for the people to go.@@@

The guards cried out,
“The Israelites are
 getting away! Follow them.
” It was very dark
 and foggy in Pharaoh's camp.
The Egyptian soldiers didn't
 know where they were going.
They followed the sound
 of voices and tramping feet.
Horses pulled the big chariots along
 the path in the Red Sea.@@@

When the fog went away,
the soldiers saw the big walls
 of water on each side of them.
The wheels of the big chariots
 were beginning to sink in the sand.
Pharaoh's army was very frightened.
They tried to turn around,
but it was too late.
“The Israelites' God is
 fighting for them!” they said.
And it was true.@@@

God looked down sadly
 at Pharaoh and his soldiers.
He had tried to help them
 know that He was the true God.
He wanted them
 to love Him,
but they would not.@@@

“Put out your rod,
” God told Moses.
Moses obeyed and the waters of the Red
 Sea came crashing down on Pharaoh and his army.
Not one of God's
 people was hurt or lost.
They all stood safe
 on the other shore.@@@

Moses made up a song.
The men sang
 the song with Moses.
It was a song of thanks and
 praise to the great God of heaven.@@@

Moses' sister,
Miriam,
took her tambourine and
 began to play and sing.
The women sang with her.@@@

“I will sing
 unto the Lord,
” they sang,
“The horse and his rider
 hath He thrown into the sea.
