God told Adam and Eve that they could eat
 fruit from all the trees in the garden except one.
God told them they would die
 if they ate from the forbidden tree.@@@

One day Eve was
 near the forbidden tree.
She looked at the
 beautiful fruit on the tree.
"I wonder why God said
 we should not eat that fruit,
" she said.@@@

As Eve stood there,
she heard a
 voice talking to her.
Who could it be? A snake with lovely wings
 was resting on one of the branches of the tree.
A snake cannot talk,
but Satan was
 talking through the snake.
Eve walked closer
 to the tree.@@@

"Did God say you should not eat fruit
 from the trees in the garden?" Satan asked.
Eve told Satan that they could eat
 fruit from all the trees but this one.@@@

"If we eat
 fruit from this tree,
God said that
 we would die,
" Eve said.@@@

"Oh no,
you won’t die,
" Satan lied.
"If you eat this fruit,
you will be very wise.
I’m eating the fruit.
Here,
take some.@@@

Eve should have run away.
But she didn’t.
She took the
 fruit in her hand.
Then she tasted
 a tiny bite.
It was very delicious.
Then Eve ate some more.
Eve took more fruit
 and ran to find Adam.
She told him about
 the snake that could talk.
"Oh,
Eve,
" Adam cried,
"That must be the enemy God
 told us about! You have disobeyed God.
Oh,
Eve,@@@

Adam loved his wife.
"She will soon die,
" he thought.
Should he obey God? "No,
" he decided.
"If Eve dies,
I will die with her.
" He took some
 fruit and ate it quickly.@@@

Satan and his
 angels were happy.
But there was
 sadness in heaven.
Disobedience had come to
 the Garden of Eden.
Sin had come
 to the beautiful,
good world God had made.
