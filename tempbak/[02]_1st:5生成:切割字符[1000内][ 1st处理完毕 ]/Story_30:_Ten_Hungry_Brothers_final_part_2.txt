They wondered if<break time="2s"/> he was still alive.<break time="2s"/>
They were sorry for what<break time="2s"/> they had done to their brother.<break time="2s"/>

When Josephâ€™s ten<break time="2s"/> brothers got to Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
they went to the governor<break time="2s"/> of Egypt to buy food.<break time="2s"/>
They did not know that<break time="2s"/> the governor was their brother Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
But when Joseph saw them,<break time="1.8s"/>
he knew them right away.<break time="1.8s"/>
They bowed down<break time="2s"/> in front of him,<break time="2s"/>
and he remembered his dreams.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph saw that Benjamin<break time="2s"/> was not with the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Had they done<break time="2s"/> something bad to him,<break time="2s"/>
too? He thought<break time="2s"/> about his father.<break time="2s"/>
