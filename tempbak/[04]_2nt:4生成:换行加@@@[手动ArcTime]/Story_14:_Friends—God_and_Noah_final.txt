God had made
 a beautiful new world.
He had created people to
 be part of His family.
He wanted them
 to love Him.
He wanted them
 to be happy.
But as years went by,
people were more
 and more disobedient.
They did not love God.
They chose Satan’s ways.@@@

God knew they could not be
 happy if they kept doing wrong things.@@@

There were a few people
 in the world who loved God.
Maybe these friends
 could help Him.
They could tell others about
 how much God loved them.@@@

Noah was one
 of God’s good friends.
God asked him to help.
He hoped people
 would listen to Noah.@@@

“Noah,
” God said one day,
“This world is
 filled with sin.
People are not good.
They are not happy.
I will send a flood of waters to
 wash away the bad things on the earth.@@@

Noah was sad,
but he knew
 God was right.
He knew the wrong
 things must be stopped.
If they kept on,
Satan would soon be
 ruler of everyone on earth.
No one could
 be happy then.@@@

God told Noah what
 He wanted him to do.
“I want you to build
 an ark—a great big boat.
Water will come
 down from the sky.
The earth will
 be covered with water.
The ark is to keep
 you safe from the flood.
It will keep your
 wife and your sons safe,
too.
It will hold all the
 people who want to come in.
Anyone who is in the ark
 will be saved from the flood.@@@

Noah was surprised! A big boat on dry land!
 Water from the sky! It had never rained before.@@@

He was surprised again when God told
 him how big the boat should be.
It was to
 be very big.
God wanted it big so people
 would know there was room for them.
There must be
 room for many animals,
too.
God would save
 some of every kind.@@@

God told Noah to build the
 ark out of very strong wood.
He was to cover it with
 pitch to keep out the water.
He was to make a big
 door on one side of the boat.
The ark was to
 be three stories high.
It would have a
 big window on top.@@@

Noah loved God very much.
He started to
 work right away.
First,
he picked a place
 to build the ark.
He wanted it where
 many people could see it.@@@

On the grass Noah marked
 the size of the boat.
He got men to
 help him cut down trees.
Then they started to
 build the big boat.
While they worked he
 told them about God’s plan.
He told about the
 ark and the flood.
And he told them
 about how God loved them.
“If you come
 into the ark,
you can be safe,
” Noah said.
