They might tell<break time="2s"/> Esau where he was.<break time="2s"/>
He found a place in<break time="2s"/> the woods to spend the night.<break time="2s"/>
He felt he<break time="2s"/> could not pray.<break time="2s"/>
He could not sleep.<break time="1.3s"/>
Then he began calling to<break time="2s"/> God to forgive his sins.<break time="2s"/>
At last,<break time="1s"/>
with his head on<break time="2s"/> a rock for a pillow,<break time="2s"/>
he fell asleep.<break time="1s"/>

God had been with<break time="2s"/> Jacob all the time.<break time="2s"/>
He had not left him.<break time="1.8s"/>
He felt very<break time="2s"/> sorry for Jacob.<break time="2s"/>
He was glad that Jacob was<break time="2s"/> sorry for what he had done.<break time="2s"/>
Now God did<break time="2s"/> something special for him.<break time="2s"/>
He gave Jacob<break time="2s"/> a beautiful dream.<break time="2s"/>
