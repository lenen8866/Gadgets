On the third day,
God made the new world very
 beautiful for the people He would make.
He made dry land.
He put the waters
 in seas and lakes,
and in rivers and streams.@@@

Then God spoke again.
"Let grass and flowers and
 trees grow on the earth.
" Right away,
green grass covered
 the brown earth.
Flowers filled the
 world with color.
There were trees of
 all shapes and sizes.
There was fruit on
 many of the trees.
Vegetables were growing for
 the people to eat.@@@

Evening came.
The third day was done.
God saw that His
 work was very good.
