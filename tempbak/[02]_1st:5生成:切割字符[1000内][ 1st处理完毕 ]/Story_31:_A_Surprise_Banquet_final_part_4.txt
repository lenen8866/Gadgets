Joseph asked them,<break time="1s"/>

“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
our father is well,<break time="1.3s"/>
” they answered.<break time="1s"/>

“And is this your youngest<break time="2s"/> brother?” Joseph asked looking at Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>

A good meal was<break time="2s"/> ready for the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
There was food<break time="2s"/> for all of them,<break time="2s"/>
but Joseph gave Benjamin five times as<break time="2s"/> much food as he gave the others.<break time="2s"/>
He listened to the brothers<break time="2s"/> talking and heard only kind words.<break time="2s"/>
After the dinner,<break time="1s"/>
