<break time="0.5s"/>Nineveh was the<break time="2s"/> capital city of Assyria.<break time="2s"/>
It was a great city,<break time="1.8s"/>
but the people of<break time="2s"/> this city were wicked.<break time="2s"/>

God loved the<break time="2s"/> wicked people in Nineveh.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them to love<break time="2s"/> Him and repent of their evil.<break time="2s"/>
So God said<break time="2s"/> to his prophet Jonah,<break time="2s"/>
“Go to Nineveh.<break time="1s"/>
Tell them that because of their wickedness I<break time="2s"/> am going to destroy their city in forty days.<break time="2s"/>
” God knew that message<break time="2s"/> would make them stop and think.<break time="2s"/>

Jonah was afraid<break time="2s"/> to go to Nineveh.<break time="2s"/>
He made a plan.<break time="1.3s"/>
He would go so far away<break time="2s"/> that God could not find him.<break time="2s"/>
