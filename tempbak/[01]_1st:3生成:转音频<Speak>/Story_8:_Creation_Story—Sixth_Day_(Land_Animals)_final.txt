<break time="0.5s"/>On the sixth<break time="2s"/> day God spoke again.<break time="2s"/>
"Let the earth bring<break time="2s"/> forth the living creature.<break time="2s"/>
" And there<break time="2s"/> they wereâ€”land animals.<break time="2s"/>

There were giraffes<break time="2s"/> with long necks.<break time="2s"/>
There were turtles with<break time="2s"/> hard shells on their backs.<break time="2s"/>
There were hopping<break time="2s"/> kangaroos and woolly lambs.<break time="2s"/>

Dogs barked and cows mooed.<break time="1.8s"/>

God liked the<break time="2s"/> animals He had made.<break time="2s"/>
He knew that the people He<break time="2s"/> was going to create would like them,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

God was nearly<break time="2s"/> finished making the world.<break time="2s"/>
He was going to create the<break time="2s"/> most important thing last of all.<break time="2s"/>
