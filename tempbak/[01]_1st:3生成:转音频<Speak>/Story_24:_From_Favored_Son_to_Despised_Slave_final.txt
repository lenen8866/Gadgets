<break time="0.5s"/>Joseph fell down,<break time="1s"/>
down into the well.<break time="1.3s"/>
There was no<break time="2s"/> water in this well,<break time="2s"/>
but it was deep.<break time="1.3s"/>

After the brothers pushed<break time="2s"/> Joseph into the well,<break time="2s"/>
they heard him crying and<break time="2s"/> begging them to take him out.<break time="2s"/>
But they just went away and<break time="2s"/> sat down to eat their lunch.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was hungry,<break time="1s"/>
but they didn’t<break time="2s"/> give him any food.<break time="2s"/>

Down in the<break time="2s"/> valley below them,<break time="2s"/>
they saw a long line of<break time="2s"/> camels walking along the dusty road.<break time="2s"/>
“I think the men on those camels are<break time="2s"/> going to Egypt to sell spices and slaves,<break time="2s"/>
” said one brother.<break time="1.3s"/>

Judah jumped up.<break time="1s"/>
“I have an<break time="2s"/> idea!” he said.<break time="2s"/>
“Let’s sell Joseph<break time="2s"/> for a slave.<break time="2s"/>
Then we’ll get some money.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph won’t die.<break time="1s"/>
After all,<break time="1s"/>
he is our brother.<break time="1.3s"/>

“That’s a good<break time="2s"/> idea!” said another brother.<break time="2s"/>
“Joseph must never<break time="2s"/> see Father again.<break time="2s"/>
He would tell on us.<break time="1.8s"/>
We must get<break time="2s"/> rid of him.<break time="2s"/>

They hurried to the<break time="2s"/> well and pulled Joseph out.<break time="2s"/>
The camels were<break time="2s"/> getting very near now.<break time="2s"/>
The brothers waved<break time="2s"/> for them to stop.<break time="2s"/>

When Joseph heard what his<break time="2s"/> brothers were planning to do,<break time="2s"/>
he started to cry again.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Please don’t sell me! Don’t make me a<break time="2s"/> slave! Think of our dear father at home.<break time="2s"/>
” But they wouldn’t listen.<break time="1.8s"/>
They sold Joseph for<break time="2s"/> twenty pieces of silver.<break time="2s"/>

The men gave the<break time="2s"/> money to the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Then they grabbed Joseph and<break time="2s"/> chained him to some other slaves.<break time="2s"/>

“That’s the last we’ll<break time="2s"/> see of the dreamer,<break time="2s"/>
” the brothers said.<break time="1.3s"/>
They watched the<break time="2s"/> camels leave with Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

The caravan of<break time="2s"/> camels moved on.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was sad.<break time="1s"/>
How could he be a slave? He<break time="2s"/> had always had his father’s loving care.<break time="2s"/>

The camels went southward.<break time="1.3s"/>
After travelling several days,<break time="1.3s"/>
Joseph could see the<break time="2s"/> place where his home was.<break time="2s"/>
Over there,<break time="1s"/>
not so far away,<break time="1.3s"/>
his father was waiting.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was waiting for<break time="2s"/> Joseph to come home.<break time="2s"/>
How sad Jacob would be when he<break time="2s"/> found that Joseph was not coming home.<break time="2s"/>

The trip was hard<break time="2s"/> and long for Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
For nearly twelve days the men with the<break time="2s"/> camels and slaves travelled over the hot desert sands.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was very<break time="2s"/> tired and hot.<break time="2s"/>

He thought about the things he<break time="2s"/> had planned to do for God.<break time="2s"/>
Now he would<break time="2s"/> be a slave.<break time="2s"/>
He thought of his dreams.<break time="1.8s"/>
“I’m sure God<break time="2s"/> gave them to me,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“I’m sure He has a<break time="2s"/> special plan for my life.<break time="2s"/>

Then he thought of the stories Grandfather<break time="2s"/> Isaac and Father Jacob had told him.<break time="2s"/>
He remembered how God had talked<break time="2s"/> to Grandfather Isaac and to his father.<break time="2s"/>
He remembered how God<break time="2s"/> had cared for them.<break time="2s"/>
“God will care for me,<break time="1.8s"/>
too,<break time="0.5s"/>
” Joseph thought.<break time="1s"/>

Right then Joseph decided.<break time="1.3s"/>
“I will always trust God,<break time="1.8s"/>
no matter what<break time="2s"/> happens to me.<break time="2s"/>
” Joseph was brave<break time="2s"/> and wiped away his tears.<break time="2s"/>
