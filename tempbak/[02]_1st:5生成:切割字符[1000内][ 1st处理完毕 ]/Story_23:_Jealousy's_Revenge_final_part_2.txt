Father Jacob began to<break time="2s"/> wonder what was happening.<break time="2s"/>

“I am worried<break time="2s"/> about your brothers,<break time="2s"/>
” Jacob said to Joseph.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Maybe something is wrong.<break time="1.3s"/>
I want you to<break time="2s"/> go and find them.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph put on his coat,<break time="1.8s"/>
took his lunch and<break time="2s"/> some food for his brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Then he kissed his<break time="2s"/> father and Benjamin good-bye.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph walked and walked.<break time="1.3s"/>
He sang songs<break time="2s"/> and talked to God.<break time="2s"/>
He thought about things he would like<break time="2s"/> to do for God when he was older.<break time="2s"/>
At night he lay down<break time="2s"/> under the stars to sleep.<break time="2s"/>
He knew God<break time="2s"/> was near him,<break time="2s"/>
and he was not afraid.<break time="1.8s"/>
