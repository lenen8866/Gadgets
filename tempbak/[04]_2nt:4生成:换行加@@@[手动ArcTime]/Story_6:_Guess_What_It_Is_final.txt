It could be seen
 on the fourth day.
It is really a sun.
It is very far away.
You cannot see
 it in the daytime.
You can see
 it in the night.
There are so many of
 them you cannot count them.@@@

The beautiful plants that
 God had created needed sunshine.
So on the
 fourth day God said,
"Let there be
 lights in the sky.
" The clouds moved away
 and there was the sun,
a very big
 ball of fire.
For the first time the
 warm sunlight shone on the earth.
It touched the plants.
They began to grow.
The sunshine made
 everything pretty and warm.@@@

For the darkness of night God
 created the stars and the moon.
These give us
 light at night.
They help make
 the night sky beautiful.
They help us to
 know the months and seasons,
too.@@@

Evening came.
The fourth day was done.
God saw that His
 work was very good.@@@

Color each space in

Then you will
 know what it is.@@@
