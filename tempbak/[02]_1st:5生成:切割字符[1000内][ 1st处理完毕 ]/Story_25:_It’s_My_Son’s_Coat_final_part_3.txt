they tore Joseph’s coat and put<break time="2s"/> some blood from an animal on it.<break time="2s"/>
They wanted it to look like<break time="2s"/> a wild animal had killed him.<break time="2s"/>

In a few days they got all the cows<break time="2s"/> and sheep and goats together and started for home.<break time="2s"/>

The first thing Jacob said<break time="2s"/> when he saw the brothers was,<break time="2s"/>

“Joseph? Isn’t he with<break time="2s"/> you?” the brothers asked.<break time="2s"/>

“No! no!” said Jacob,<break time="1.3s"/>
“I sent him<break time="2s"/> to find you.<break time="2s"/>

Then the brothers<break time="2s"/> acted sad and worried.<break time="2s"/>
Slowly they brought out the torn<break time="2s"/> coat with blood stains on it.<break time="2s"/>
“We found this<break time="2s"/> in a field,<break time="2s"/>
” they said,<break time="1s"/>
as they gave<break time="2s"/> Joseph’s coat to Jacob.<break time="2s"/>
