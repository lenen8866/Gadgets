This was Godâ€™s<break time="2s"/> plan for my life.<break time="2s"/>
God wanted me to teach the people<break time="2s"/> of Egypt about the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted me to<break time="2s"/> keep many people from starving.<break time="2s"/>
We have had two<break time="2s"/> bad years of famine.<break time="2s"/>
There will be five more<break time="2s"/> years when nothing can grow.<break time="2s"/>
Now go back and tell my<break time="2s"/> father that I am still alive.<break time="2s"/>
I want Father and all of<break time="2s"/> you to come to Egypt to live.<break time="2s"/>
Then you will<break time="2s"/> have food to eat.<break time="2s"/>
Come to Egypt and<break time="2s"/> bring everything that you have.<break time="2s"/>

Then Joseph put his arms around<break time="2s"/> Benjamin and they both cried for happiness.<break time="2s"/>
Then,<break time="0.5s"/>
one by one,<break time="1s"/>
