As the sky got darker,<break time="1.8s"/>
the cloud got brighter.<break time="1.3s"/>
Soon it was<break time="2s"/> a pillar of fire.<break time="2s"/>
There was light<break time="2s"/> in the camp.<break time="2s"/>
It was not cold<break time="2s"/> and not dark anymore.<break time="2s"/>

“What is it?”<break time="2s"/> the people asked.<break time="2s"/>

Moses knew.<break time="1s"/>
He told the people,<break time="1.3s"/>
“God has put<break time="2s"/> the cloud there.<break time="2s"/>
He will take<break time="2s"/> care of us.<break time="2s"/>
He is our leader.<break time="1.3s"/>
We will follow the cloud.<break time="1.8s"/>

The next day the<break time="2s"/> cloud started to move.<break time="2s"/>
The cloud gave shade from<break time="2s"/> the desert sun in the daytime.<break time="2s"/>
Everyone packed up their tents<break time="2s"/> and food and followed the cloud.<break time="2s"/>
