” Joseph could<break time="2s"/> hardly keep from crying.<break time="2s"/>
This was Judah,<break time="1s"/>
the same brother who had told<break time="2s"/> the brothers to sell Joseph years ago.<break time="2s"/>
Now he was<break time="2s"/> unselfish and kind.<break time="2s"/>

“Leave the room,<break time="1s"/>
” Joseph said<break time="2s"/> to all his servants.<break time="2s"/>
When they had gone,<break time="1.3s"/>
Joseph cried out loud.<break time="1.3s"/>

“I am Joseph,<break time="1s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>

Joseph! How could this be Joseph?<break time="2s"/> “But he is speaking our language,<break time="2s"/>
” one of<break time="2s"/> the brothers said.<break time="2s"/>
“Now he will punish us<break time="2s"/> for what we did to him.<break time="2s"/>

But Joseph spoke<break time="2s"/> kindly to them.<break time="2s"/>
“Don’t be angry with<break time="2s"/> yourselves for selling me.<break time="2s"/>
