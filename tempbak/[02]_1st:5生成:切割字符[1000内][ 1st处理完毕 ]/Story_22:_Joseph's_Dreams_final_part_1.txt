<break time="0.5s"/>One night Joseph<break time="2s"/> had a strange dream.<break time="2s"/>
He woke up in<break time="2s"/> the morning thinking about it.<break time="2s"/>
He did not know that an<break time="2s"/> angel had given him the dream.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph told his<break time="2s"/> brothers about it.<break time="2s"/>
“Listen to my dream,<break time="1.3s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“It’s about you! I dreamed<break time="2s"/> we were working in the field.<break time="2s"/>
We were tying<break time="2s"/> the grain into bundles.<break time="2s"/>

“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
what?” the brothers asked.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Well,<break time="0.5s"/>
suddenly my bundle stood straight up! Then all<break time="2s"/> your bundles stood up and bowed to mine.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers were angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
They all began<break time="2s"/> to talk at once.<break time="2s"/>
