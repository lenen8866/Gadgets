<break time="0.5s"/>It was a<break time="2s"/> very busy morning.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph’s older brothers were<break time="2s"/> going on a long trip.<break time="2s"/>
The grass around the place<break time="2s"/> where they were living was gone.<break time="2s"/>
The sheep and goats<break time="2s"/> had nothing to eat.<break time="2s"/>
The brothers were taking<break time="2s"/> the animals to Shechem,<break time="2s"/>
a place far away where<break time="2s"/> there was a lot of grass.<break time="2s"/>
Donkeys were loaded with<break time="2s"/> water bags and food.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob called the family together.<break time="1.8s"/>
He asked God to care for his<break time="2s"/> sons and the animals on their long trip.<break time="2s"/>

Days and weeks went by.<break time="1.8s"/>
The brothers were gone<break time="2s"/> for a long time.<break time="2s"/>
Father Jacob began to<break time="2s"/> wonder what was happening.<break time="2s"/>

“I am worried<break time="2s"/> about your brothers,<break time="2s"/>
” Jacob said to Joseph.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Maybe something is wrong.<break time="1.3s"/>
I want you to<break time="2s"/> go and find them.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph put on his coat,<break time="1.8s"/>
took his lunch and<break time="2s"/> some food for his brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Then he kissed his<break time="2s"/> father and Benjamin good-bye.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph walked and walked.<break time="1.3s"/>
He sang songs<break time="2s"/> and talked to God.<break time="2s"/>
He thought about things he would like<break time="2s"/> to do for God when he was older.<break time="2s"/>
At night he lay down<break time="2s"/> under the stars to sleep.<break time="2s"/>
He knew God<break time="2s"/> was near him,<break time="2s"/>
and he was not afraid.<break time="1.8s"/>

When he got to Shechem<break time="2s"/> where his brothers had gone,<break time="2s"/>
they were not there.<break time="1.3s"/>
He looked and looked,<break time="1.3s"/>
but he could<break time="2s"/> not find them.<break time="2s"/>
A man saw Joseph<break time="2s"/> walking around in a field.<break time="2s"/>
He told Joseph that his<break time="2s"/> brothers had gone to Dothan.<break time="2s"/>

Poor Joseph! He was so tired!<break time="2s"/> But he must find his brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Father would be waiting<break time="2s"/> to hear how they were.<break time="2s"/>
The sun was hot.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was hungry and thirsty.<break time="1.8s"/>
As he walked he hoped it would<break time="2s"/> not take too long to get to Dothan.<break time="2s"/>

At last he saw<break time="2s"/> some tents far away.<break time="2s"/>
He walked faster.<break time="1s"/>
Yes! He was sure<break time="2s"/> those were his brothers’ tents.<break time="2s"/>
He was so happy.<break time="1.3s"/>

Joseph did not know that<break time="2s"/> his brothers had seen him.<break time="2s"/>
He was wearing<break time="2s"/> his bright coat,<break time="2s"/>
so they knew<break time="2s"/> it was Joseph coming.<break time="2s"/>

“Here comes the dreamer,<break time="1.3s"/>
” said one brother.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Let’s get rid of him,<break time="1.8s"/>
” said another.<break time="1s"/>

Reuben was the oldest brother.<break time="1.8s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
don’t hurt him.<break time="1s"/>
He is our brother.<break time="1.3s"/>
Throw him down that<break time="2s"/> dry well over there.<break time="2s"/>
” Reuben thought,<break time="1s"/>
“Later I will help him<break time="2s"/> get out of the well.<break time="2s"/>
Then he can<break time="2s"/> go back home.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph ran the last little<break time="2s"/> way to his brothers’ tents.<break time="2s"/>
He waved happily,<break time="1s"/>
but the brothers<break time="2s"/> did not wave back.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph looked from one<break time="2s"/> brother to the other.<break time="2s"/>
There were no<break time="2s"/> smiles of welcome.<break time="2s"/>
His brothers’ faces<break time="2s"/> looked angry and mean.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was afraid.<break time="1s"/>

They grabbed him.<break time="1s"/>
They tore off<break time="2s"/> his beautiful coat.<break time="2s"/>
Then they pulled him<break time="2s"/> to the old well.<break time="2s"/>

“I brought you<break time="2s"/> food from father,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“Father sent me to you.<break time="1.8s"/>
Oh,<break time="0.5s"/>
please don’t hurt me.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Now we’ll see what<break time="2s"/> happens to those dreams,<break time="2s"/>
” the brothers said.<break time="1.3s"/>
And they pushed<break time="2s"/> him down the well.<break time="2s"/>
