Down in the valley his<break time="2s"/> friend was building a house too.<break time="2s"/>
It was easy to dig<break time="2s"/> the foundation in the sand.<break time="2s"/>
He laughed at the man on<break time="2s"/> the hill who was working so hard.<break time="2s"/>

Since the wise man wanted<break time="2s"/> to build the best house possible,<break time="2s"/>
he laid the foundation<break time="2s"/> on the solid rock.<break time="2s"/>
He looked for the<break time="2s"/> best stones he could find.<break time="2s"/>
The strong walls<break time="2s"/> began to rise,<break time="2s"/>
stone upon stone.<break time="1s"/>
At last his<break time="2s"/> house was finished.<break time="2s"/>
It stood on<break time="2s"/> a strong foundation,<break time="2s"/>
firm,<break time="0.5s"/>
straight and beautiful.<break time="1s"/>

The storms came.<break time="1s"/>
Rain poured down.<break time="1s"/>
