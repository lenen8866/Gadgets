Noah and his family walked out of the<break time="2s"/> ark into the fresh air and warm sunshine.<break time="2s"/>
They had been in the<break time="2s"/> ark for a long time.<break time="2s"/>

All the animals came<break time="2s"/> out of the ark.<break time="2s"/>
They were happy to be<break time="2s"/> able to run and jump.<break time="2s"/>
The birds went flying away,<break time="1.8s"/>
high in the sky.<break time="1.3s"/>

Soon the animals<break time="2s"/> had gone away.<break time="2s"/>
But some animals,<break time="1s"/>
like cats and dogs,<break time="1.3s"/>
sheep and goats,<break time="1s"/>
stayed near the people.<break time="1.3s"/>

The first thing Noahâ€™s family did when they came out<break time="2s"/> of the ark was to thank God for keeping them safe.<break time="2s"/>
Then they saw a bright<break time="2s"/> rainbow shining across the sky.<break time="2s"/>
