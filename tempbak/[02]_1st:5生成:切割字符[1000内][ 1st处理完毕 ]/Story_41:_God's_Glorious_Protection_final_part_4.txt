He took his chariots and soldiers<break time="2s"/> and went after the people of Israel.<break time="2s"/>
He and his army hurried very fast<break time="2s"/> and found the camp by the sea.<break time="2s"/>

“The Israelites are trapped,<break time="1.3s"/>
” Pharaoh said.<break time="1s"/>
“They have no<break time="2s"/> place to go.<break time="2s"/>
They will have to<break time="2s"/> come back with us.<break time="2s"/>
This will be easy.<break time="1.3s"/>

But when Pharaoh and his soldiers<break time="2s"/> got very close to the Israelite's camp,<break time="2s"/>
they had to stop.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was dark,<break time="1s"/>
and there was fog too.<break time="1.8s"/>
The army would have<break time="2s"/> to wait till morning light.<break time="2s"/>

It was not dark<break time="2s"/> in the camp of Israel.<break time="2s"/>
The pillar of fire made<break time="2s"/> the camp bright on their side.<break time="2s"/>
