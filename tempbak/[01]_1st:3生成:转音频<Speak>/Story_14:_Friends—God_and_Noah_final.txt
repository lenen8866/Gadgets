<break time="0.5s"/>God had made<break time="2s"/> a beautiful new world.<break time="2s"/>
He had created people to<break time="2s"/> be part of His family.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to love Him.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to be happy.<break time="2s"/>
But as years went by,<break time="1.8s"/>
people were more<break time="2s"/> and more disobedient.<break time="2s"/>
They did not love God.<break time="1.8s"/>
They chose Satan’s ways.<break time="1.3s"/>

God knew they could not be<break time="2s"/> happy if they kept doing wrong things.<break time="2s"/>

There were a few people<break time="2s"/> in the world who loved God.<break time="2s"/>
Maybe these friends<break time="2s"/> could help Him.<break time="2s"/>
They could tell others about<break time="2s"/> how much God loved them.<break time="2s"/>

Noah was one<break time="2s"/> of God’s good friends.<break time="2s"/>
God asked him to help.<break time="1.8s"/>
He hoped people<break time="2s"/> would listen to Noah.<break time="2s"/>

“Noah,<break time="0.5s"/>
” God said one day,<break time="1.8s"/>
“This world is<break time="2s"/> filled with sin.<break time="2s"/>
People are not good.<break time="1.3s"/>
They are not happy.<break time="1.3s"/>
I will send a flood of waters to<break time="2s"/> wash away the bad things on the earth.<break time="2s"/>

Noah was sad,<break time="1s"/>
but he knew<break time="2s"/> God was right.<break time="2s"/>
He knew the wrong<break time="2s"/> things must be stopped.<break time="2s"/>
If they kept on,<break time="1.3s"/>
Satan would soon be<break time="2s"/> ruler of everyone on earth.<break time="2s"/>
No one could<break time="2s"/> be happy then.<break time="2s"/>

God told Noah what<break time="2s"/> He wanted him to do.<break time="2s"/>
“I want you to build<break time="2s"/> an ark—a great big boat.<break time="2s"/>
Water will come<break time="2s"/> down from the sky.<break time="2s"/>
The earth will<break time="2s"/> be covered with water.<break time="2s"/>
The ark is to keep<break time="2s"/> you safe from the flood.<break time="2s"/>
It will keep your<break time="2s"/> wife and your sons safe,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
It will hold all the<break time="2s"/> people who want to come in.<break time="2s"/>
Anyone who is in the ark<break time="2s"/> will be saved from the flood.<break time="2s"/>

Noah was surprised! A big boat on dry land!<break time="2s"/> Water from the sky! It had never rained before.<break time="2s"/>

He was surprised again when God told<break time="2s"/> him how big the boat should be.<break time="2s"/>
It was to<break time="2s"/> be very big.<break time="2s"/>
God wanted it big so people<break time="2s"/> would know there was room for them.<break time="2s"/>
There must be<break time="2s"/> room for many animals,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
God would save<break time="2s"/> some of every kind.<break time="2s"/>

God told Noah to build the<break time="2s"/> ark out of very strong wood.<break time="2s"/>
He was to cover it with<break time="2s"/> pitch to keep out the water.<break time="2s"/>
He was to make a big<break time="2s"/> door on one side of the boat.<break time="2s"/>
The ark was to<break time="2s"/> be three stories high.<break time="2s"/>
It would have a<break time="2s"/> big window on top.<break time="2s"/>

Noah loved God very much.<break time="1.8s"/>
He started to<break time="2s"/> work right away.<break time="2s"/>
First,<break time="0.5s"/>
he picked a place<break time="2s"/> to build the ark.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted it where<break time="2s"/> many people could see it.<break time="2s"/>

On the grass Noah marked<break time="2s"/> the size of the boat.<break time="2s"/>
He got men to<break time="2s"/> help him cut down trees.<break time="2s"/>
Then they started to<break time="2s"/> build the big boat.<break time="2s"/>
While they worked he<break time="2s"/> told them about God’s plan.<break time="2s"/>
He told about the<break time="2s"/> ark and the flood.<break time="2s"/>
And he told them<break time="2s"/> about how God loved them.<break time="2s"/>
“If you come<break time="2s"/> into the ark,<break time="2s"/>
you can be safe,<break time="1.3s"/>
” Noah said.<break time="1s"/>
