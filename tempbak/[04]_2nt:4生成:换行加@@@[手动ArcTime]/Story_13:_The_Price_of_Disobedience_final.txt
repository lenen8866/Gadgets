After Adam and Eve ate the
 fruit they began to feel afraid.
The clothes of light that
 God had given them were gone.
That evening when God
 came to the garden,
Adam and Eve tried
 to hide in some bushes.@@@

God called Adam and Eve.
He asked,
“Did you eat fruit from the forbidden tree?”
 Adam told God that Eve made him do it.
Eve blamed the snake.
God was sad.
But He spoke
 kindly to His children.
“You will have
 to leave the garden.
You and all
 living things will die.
” So Adam and Eve
 sadly left their beautiful garden home.
But God still loved them.@@@

The next morning angels came to tell them about
 God’s love and a new plan He had made.
“God says that He will give you another
 chance to show Him that you love Him,
” the angels said.@@@

“But how? How can
 this be?” Adam asked.@@@

“Jesus,
God’s Son,
will die in your place.
” Then the
 angels told them more.
“God will send His Son,
Jesus,
to this world
 as a baby.
He will grow up and
 help people to know God better.
He will die for the
 wrong things you have done.
God will raise Jesus up and
 He will go back to heaven.
One day He will come and
 take His people to be with Him.
