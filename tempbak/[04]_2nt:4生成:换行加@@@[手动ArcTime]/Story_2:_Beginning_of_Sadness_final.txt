God made a
 special angel named Lucifer.
He was very beautiful.
He was a leader of
 the other angels in heaven.
He led the choir.
All the angels loved Lucifer.@@@

Little by little,
Lucifer began to think
 about how special he was.
"I am the most beautiful
 and the wisest angel of all,
" he said.@@@

God the Father and God
 the Son had a meeting.
"Why didnâ€™t they invite me
 to the meeting?" Lucifer thought.
"I am a
 very special angel.
" Lucifer was jealous
 of God the Son.@@@

Then Lucifer started to
 talk to the other angels.
"God is not fair,
" he said.
"He likes the
 Son better than me.
" The angels were surprised.
They loved God.
But slowly,
some of the
 angels believed Lucifer.@@@

God the Father and
 the Son talked with Lucifer.
They tried to help him.
But Lucifer wanted
 to be like God.
A being God had made
 could not be like Him.@@@

At last,
God had to send
 Lucifer out of heaven.
Many of the
 angels went with him.
It was a very
 sad time in heaven.@@@

Now Lucifer chose to be
 an angel of lies and hate.
He was called Satan.
He wanted to do
 everything he could against God.
He wanted angels and people
 to be on his side.
He wants you to
 be on his side,
too.
We should not
 listen to Satan.
