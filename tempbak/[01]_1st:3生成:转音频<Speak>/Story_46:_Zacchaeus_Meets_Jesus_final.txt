<break time="0.5s"/>Mr.<break time="0.5s"/>
and Mrs.<break time="1s"/>
Zacchaeus and their children lived in one of<break time="2s"/> the most beautiful houses in the city of Jericho.<break time="2s"/>
Zacchaeus was rich but<break time="2s"/> he was not happy.<break time="2s"/>

He was a tax collector<break time="2s"/> for the Roman rulers in Jericho.<break time="2s"/>
He was a short man,<break time="1.8s"/>
but his job made<break time="2s"/> him feel big and important.<break time="2s"/>

For years he had made the<break time="2s"/> people pay too much money for taxes.<break time="2s"/>
He kept the<break time="2s"/> extra money for himself.<break time="2s"/>
Most tax collectors did that.<break time="1.8s"/>
Some of the poor people had hardly<break time="2s"/> enough money left to buy food and clothes.<break time="2s"/>
Zacchaeus got richer and richer,<break time="1.8s"/>
but money did<break time="2s"/> not make him happy.<break time="2s"/>
The people hated him.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Liar! Cheat!” they called him.<break time="1.8s"/>

Zacchaeus knew what the Bible<break time="2s"/> says about stealing and cheating.<break time="2s"/>
He knew what the Bible<break time="2s"/> says about helping poor people,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
He wanted to<break time="2s"/> change his ways but,<break time="2s"/>
he didn’t know how.<break time="1.3s"/>
When he tried to<break time="2s"/> go to the synagogue,<break time="2s"/>
the priests wouldn’t let<break time="2s"/> him in the door.<break time="2s"/>
“Go away!” they said.<break time="1.3s"/>
“You are too great a<break time="2s"/> sinner to come to church.<break time="2s"/>

Then one day a<break time="2s"/> man told him about Jesus,<break time="2s"/>
the great teacher.<break time="1s"/>
“He has twelve disciples,<break time="1.3s"/>
” this man said.<break time="1.3s"/>
“One of them<break time="2s"/> was a tax collector.<break time="2s"/>

When Zacchaeus heard that,<break time="1.3s"/>
he thought,<break time="1s"/>
“Jesus has a tax collector for a<break time="2s"/> special friend! Maybe there is hope for me.<break time="2s"/>

At once he began making things<break time="2s"/> right with people whom he had cheated.<break time="2s"/>
He gave food and clothing<break time="2s"/> and gifts to poor people.<break time="2s"/>
For the first time in his<break time="2s"/> life he began to feel happy.<break time="2s"/>

One day Zacchaeus looked up from the<break time="2s"/> money he was counting in his tax booth.<break time="2s"/>
He saw a crowd of<break time="2s"/> people coming down the street.<break time="2s"/>
“What’s all the<break time="2s"/> excitement?” he called.<break time="2s"/>

“Jesus is passing<break time="2s"/> through our city,<break time="2s"/>
” someone shouted back.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Jesus,<break time="0.5s"/>
the Teacher,<break time="1s"/>

Quickly Zacchaeus closed his booth.<break time="1.8s"/>
He ran to the crowd.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Why am I<break time="2s"/> so short?” he said.<break time="2s"/>
“I wish I were taller.<break time="1.8s"/>
” Even standing on tiptoes,<break time="1.8s"/>
he could not see Jesus.<break time="1.8s"/>
“I must see<break time="2s"/> the Teacher!” Zacchaeus shouted.<break time="2s"/>
When people saw it<break time="2s"/> was the tax collector,<break time="2s"/>
they stood closer<break time="2s"/> together than ever.<break time="2s"/>
“Let me through,<break time="1s"/>
please,<break time="0.5s"/>
” he begged.<break time="1s"/>
No one listened to him.<break time="1.8s"/>

The crowd moved<break time="2s"/> slowly down the street.<break time="2s"/>
Zacchaeus was not<break time="2s"/> going to give up.<break time="2s"/>
Farther down the street he<break time="2s"/> saw a big sycamore tree.<break time="2s"/>
He ran ahead of<break time="2s"/> the crowd to the tree.<break time="2s"/>
He climbed out on a branch that hung<break time="2s"/> over the place where Jesus would soon walk.<break time="2s"/>

Just a few more steps<break time="2s"/> and Jesus would pass by.<break time="2s"/>
Suddenly Jesus stopped.<break time="1s"/>
He looked right<break time="2s"/> up into Zacchaeus’ face,<break time="2s"/>
and called,<break time="1s"/>
“Zacchaeus,<break time="0.5s"/>
come down! Hurry! I would like<break time="2s"/> to visit you in your house today.<break time="2s"/>
” Shaking with excitement,<break time="1.3s"/>
Zacchaeus came down<break time="2s"/> out of the tree.<break time="2s"/>
He led the<break time="2s"/> way toward his house.<break time="2s"/>

He told Jesus,<break time="1s"/>
“Sir,<break time="0.5s"/>
from now on I will give<break time="2s"/> half of my money to the poor.<break time="2s"/>
And to anyone<break time="2s"/> I have cheated,<break time="2s"/>
I will give back four times<break time="2s"/> as much as I have taken.<break time="2s"/>

Zacchaeus was filled with<break time="2s"/> joy when Jesus said,<break time="2s"/>
“Today salvation has<break time="2s"/> come to your house.<break time="2s"/>
” He knew<break time="2s"/> his sins were forgiven.<break time="2s"/>

Zacchaeus and Jesus had a<break time="2s"/> wonderful time together that day.<break time="2s"/>
