<break time="0.5s"/>God told Adam and Eve that they could eat<break time="2s"/> fruit from all the trees in the garden except one.<break time="2s"/>
God told them they would die<break time="2s"/> if they ate from the forbidden tree.<break time="2s"/>

One day Eve was<break time="2s"/> near the forbidden tree.<break time="2s"/>
She looked at the<break time="2s"/> beautiful fruit on the tree.<break time="2s"/>
"I wonder why God said<break time="2s"/> we should not eat that fruit,<break time="2s"/>
" she said.<break time="1s"/>

As Eve stood there,<break time="1.3s"/>
she heard a<break time="2s"/> voice talking to her.<break time="2s"/>
Who could it be? A snake with lovely wings<break time="2s"/> was resting on one of the branches of the tree.<break time="2s"/>
A snake cannot talk,<break time="1.3s"/>
but Satan was<break time="2s"/> talking through the snake.<break time="2s"/>
