But they were still skinny.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Then I had another dream.<break time="1.8s"/>
I saw seven heads<break time="2s"/> of grain on one stem.<break time="2s"/>
The kernels of<break time="2s"/> grain looked very good.<break time="2s"/>
There were seven more heads<break time="2s"/> of grain on the same stem.<break time="2s"/>
These did not look good<break time="2s"/> and had little dried-up kernels.<break time="2s"/>
The poor-looking heads ate<break time="2s"/> up the good ones.<break time="2s"/>
They didn’t look any better.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then I woke up.<break time="1.3s"/>
I have called you here to<break time="2s"/> tell me what my dreams mean.<break time="2s"/>

The room was very quiet.<break time="1.8s"/>
No one said anything.<break time="1.3s"/>
Pharaoh waited.<break time="1s"/>
Some of the king’s helpers tried<break time="2s"/> to act as if they were thinking.<break time="2s"/>
