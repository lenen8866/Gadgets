<break time="0.5s"/>No more prison for Joseph! God<break time="2s"/> had been with Joseph in Potiphar’s house.<break time="2s"/>
He had been with<break time="2s"/> him in the prison.<break time="2s"/>
Now God was with Joseph<break time="2s"/> as he worked for the king.<break time="2s"/>
He had workmen<break time="2s"/> build big storehouses.<break time="2s"/>
Then he bought<break time="2s"/> grain from the farmers.<break time="2s"/>
Storehouse after storehouse was filled.<break time="1.8s"/>
He was getting ready for<break time="2s"/> the bad years to come.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph got married.<break time="1s"/>
He was very happy<break time="2s"/> in his home in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Soon he had two<break time="2s"/> little boys of his own.<break time="2s"/>
He taught the boys<break time="2s"/> about the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
He told them all the stories he had heard from<break time="2s"/> his father and grandfather when he was a little boy.<break time="2s"/>

The people in<break time="2s"/> Egypt loved Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
He was kind to them<break time="2s"/> and told them about his God.<break time="2s"/>
After seven good<break time="2s"/> years had passed,<break time="2s"/>
the famine came.<break time="1s"/>
No rain fell.<break time="1s"/>
The fruit trees were dying.<break time="1.8s"/>
There was no<break time="2s"/> grass for the animals.<break time="2s"/>
The people ate all the<break time="2s"/> food they had at home.<break time="2s"/>
Then they went to Pharaoh.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Go to Joseph,<break time="1s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
Joseph opened the storehouses and<break time="2s"/> began selling food to the people.<break time="2s"/>
