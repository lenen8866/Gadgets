1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:04,708
No more prison for Joseph! God

2
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:10,042
 had been with Joseph in Potiphar’s house.

3
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:13,708
He had been with

4
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:17,000
 him in the prison.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,542
Now God was with Joseph

6
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,750
 as he worked for the king.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,458
He had workmen

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,250
 build big storehouses.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,500
Then he bought

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,250
 grain from the farmers.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,542
Storehouse after storehouse was filled.

12
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:49,667
He was getting ready for

13
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,125
 the bad years to come.@@@

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:56,792
Joseph got married.

15
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,042
He was very happy

16
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:04,042
 in his home in Egypt.

17
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:07,792
Soon he had two

18
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:11,917
 little boys of his own.

19
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:15,458
He taught the boys

20
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,542
 about the God of heaven.

21
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:24,750
He told them all the stories he had heard from

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,250
 his father and grandfather when he was a little boy.@@@

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,833
The people in

24
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,458
 Egypt loved Joseph.

25
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:41,625
He was kind to them

26
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:46,042
 and told them about his God.

27
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:49,500
After seven good

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,875
 years had passed,

29
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,917
the famine came.

30
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,750
No rain fell.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,417
The fruit trees were dying.

32
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:05,708
There was no

33
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,083
 grass for the animals.

34
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:13,417
The people ate all the

35
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:17,000
 food they had at home.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,792
Then they went to Pharaoh.

37
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,667
“Go to Joseph,

38
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,667
” he said.

39
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:30,167
Joseph opened the storehouses and

40
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:34,917
 began selling food to the people.

41
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,917
