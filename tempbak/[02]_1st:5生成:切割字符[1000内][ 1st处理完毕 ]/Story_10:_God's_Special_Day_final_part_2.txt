God came down to the Garden of Eden<break time="2s"/> to spend the first Sabbath with Adam and Eve.<break time="2s"/>
They walked in<break time="2s"/> the garden together.<break time="2s"/>
Adam and Eve asked God questions<break time="2s"/> about the things He had created.<break time="2s"/>
They looked at the<break time="2s"/> beautiful trees and flowers.<break time="2s"/>
They listened to<break time="2s"/> the singing birds.<break time="2s"/>
What a happy day the<break time="2s"/> first Sabbath was! God was happy,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

God wants us to remember<break time="2s"/> the special day He created.<break time="2s"/>
He wants us<break time="2s"/> to enjoy every Sabbath.<break time="2s"/>
