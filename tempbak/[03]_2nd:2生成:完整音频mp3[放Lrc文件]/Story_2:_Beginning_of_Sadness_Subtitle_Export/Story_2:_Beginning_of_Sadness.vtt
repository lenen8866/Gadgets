00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
God made a special angel named Lucifer.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.570
He was very beautiful.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.030
He was a leader of the other angels in heaven.

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.420
He led the choir.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.060
All the angels loved Lucifer.<br>

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.450

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.190
Lucifer began to think about how special he was.

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.630
"I am the most beautiful and the wisest angel of all,

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.600
" he said.<br>

10
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.920
God the Father and God the Son had a meeting.

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.350
"Why didnâ€™t they invite me to the meeting?" Lucifer thought.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.150
"I am a very special angel.

13
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.910
" Lucifer was jealous of God the Son.<br>

14
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.790
Then Lucifer started to talk to the other angels.

15
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.180
"God is not fair,

16
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.580
" he said.

17
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.220
"He likes the Son better than me.

18
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.150
" The angels were surprised.

19
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.260
They loved God.

20
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.810
But slowly,

21
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.430
some of the angels believed Lucifer.<br>

22
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.030
God the Father and the Son talked with Lucifer.

23
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.260
They tried to help him.

24
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.040
But Lucifer wanted to be like God.

25
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.640
A being God had made could not be like Him.<br>

26
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.760
At last,

27
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.100
God had to send Lucifer out of heaven.

28
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.740
Many of the angels went with him.

29
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.940
It was a very sad time in heaven.<br>

30
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.960
Now Lucifer chose to be an angel of lies and hate.

31
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.770
He was called Satan.

32
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.520
He wanted to do everything he could against God.

33
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.980
He wanted angels and people to be on his side.

34
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.330
He wants you to be on his side,

35
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.900
too.

36
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.110
We should not listen to Satan.
