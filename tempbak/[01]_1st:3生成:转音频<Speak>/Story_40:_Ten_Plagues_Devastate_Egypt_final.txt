<break time="0.5s"/>Moses and Aaron went<break time="2s"/> to talk to Pharaoh again,<break time="2s"/>
but the king<break time="2s"/> would not listen.<break time="2s"/>
He would not<break time="2s"/> let the Israelites go.<break time="2s"/>
Then some bad plagues came<break time="2s"/> to the people of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
First,<break time="0.5s"/>
the Nile River<break time="2s"/> was turned to blood.<break time="2s"/>
All the water<break time="2s"/> in Egypt became blood.<break time="2s"/>
But Pharaoh would<break time="2s"/> not obey God.<break time="2s"/>
He would not let<break time="2s"/> the people of Israel go.<break time="2s"/>

Then God let more bad plagues<break time="2s"/> come to the people of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Frogs were everywhere.<break time="1s"/>
They came into the houses.<break time="1.8s"/>
They were in the beds.<break time="1.8s"/>
They were in the food.<break time="1.8s"/>
The king asked his wisemen<break time="2s"/> to make the frogs go away,<break time="2s"/>
but they could<break time="2s"/> not do it.<break time="2s"/>

Then Pharaoh called<break time="2s"/> for Moses to come.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
"Pray to your God to<break time="2s"/> make the frogs go away.<break time="2s"/>
Then I will<break time="2s"/> let your people go.<break time="2s"/>
" Moses prayed.<break time="1s"/>
All the frogs died.<break time="1.3s"/>
However,<break time="0.5s"/>
the king would not<break time="2s"/> let the people go.<break time="2s"/>

Then more plagues came.<break time="1.3s"/>
Many flies were<break time="2s"/> all over Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
But the flies were not in<break time="2s"/> Goshen where the people of Israel lived.<break time="2s"/>

There were ten<break time="2s"/> plagues in all.<break time="2s"/>
The animals got<break time="2s"/> a bad sickness.<break time="2s"/>
Many horses,<break time="1s"/>
cows,<break time="0.5s"/>
donkeys,<break time="0.5s"/>
and camels died.<break time="1s"/>
None of the<break time="2s"/> animals in Goshen died.<break time="2s"/>
God protected these animals.<break time="1.3s"/>

A big storm<break time="2s"/> came to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Rain poured down<break time="2s"/> and big hailstones fell.<break time="2s"/>
Trees were knocked down.<break time="1.3s"/>
The gardens were spoiled.<break time="1.3s"/>
People who were outside their<break time="2s"/> houses were killed by the hailstones.<break time="2s"/>

It got very<break time="2s"/> dark in Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
but it was<break time="2s"/> light in Goshen.<break time="2s"/>
Still Pharaoh would not<break time="2s"/> let the people go.<break time="2s"/>

At last Moses<break time="2s"/> went to Pharaoh again.<break time="2s"/>
He told Pharaoh that the next plague would be the worst of all: The<break time="2s"/> oldest child in every family would die if Pharaoh did not let the people go.<break time="2s"/>

Then Moses went to Goshen.<break time="1.8s"/>
He talked to God’s people.<break time="1.8s"/>
He told them to<break time="2s"/> get ready to leave Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He told them to ask their neighbors<break time="2s"/> for gifts of jewels and silver and gold.<break time="2s"/>
He told them to kill a lamb and put<break time="2s"/> the blood on the top and sides of their doors.<break time="2s"/>
"Then the angel of death<break time="2s"/> will pass over your house,<break time="2s"/>
" he said.<break time="1s"/>
"Your oldest child<break time="2s"/> will not die.<break time="2s"/>

The last night<break time="2s"/> in Egypt came.<break time="2s"/>
At midnight a child died<break time="2s"/> in nearly every home in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Even Pharaoh’s oldest son died.<break time="1.8s"/>
But the children of the<break time="2s"/> people in Goshen did not die.<break time="2s"/>
The angel saw the blood on<break time="2s"/> their doors and passed over their houses.<break time="2s"/>

Pharaoh mourned for his son.<break time="1.8s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
"Tell Moses to go with<break time="2s"/> all the people and their animals.<break time="2s"/>

In the middle of the night God’s<break time="2s"/> people began to march out of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
They were happy.<break time="1s"/>
"We are free!" they shouted.<break time="1.8s"/>
