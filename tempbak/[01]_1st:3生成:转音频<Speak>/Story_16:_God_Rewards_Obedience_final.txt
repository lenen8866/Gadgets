<break time="0.5s"/>When all the animals and<break time="2s"/> birds were inside the ark,<break time="2s"/>
God said,<break time="1s"/>
“Go into the ark,<break time="1.3s"/>
Noah.<break time="0.5s"/>
Take your family in,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

Noah felt very sorry for<break time="2s"/> the people outside the ark.<break time="2s"/>
“I wish they<break time="2s"/> would listen to me,<break time="2s"/>
” he thought sadly.<break time="1.3s"/>
Then he went inside<break time="2s"/> the ark where his wife,<break time="2s"/>
his three sons and<break time="2s"/> their wives were waiting.<break time="2s"/>

There was a<break time="2s"/> flash of light.<break time="2s"/>
An angel had come from heaven to<break time="2s"/> close the heavy door of the ark.<break time="2s"/>
Slowly the door<break time="2s"/> began to swing shut.<break time="2s"/>
Then it was closed.<break time="1.3s"/>
No person could open it.<break time="1.8s"/>

Seven days went by.<break time="1.3s"/>
The sun was shining brightly.<break time="1.8s"/>
In the ark,<break time="1s"/>
Noah and his family<break time="2s"/> were waiting for the rain.<break time="2s"/>
They knew it would rain.<break time="1.8s"/>
Around the ark the<break time="2s"/> people were having a party.<break time="2s"/>
They ate and drank.<break time="1.3s"/>
They made fun of<break time="2s"/> Noah and the boat.<break time="2s"/>
“There is no God,<break time="1.3s"/>
” they said.<break time="1s"/>

Then dark clouds began<break time="2s"/> to cover the sun.<break time="2s"/>
Thunder shook the earth.<break time="1.3s"/>
Rain began to fall.<break time="1.3s"/>
It rained harder and harder.<break time="1.8s"/>
Big fountains of water came from the<break time="2s"/> ground and threw rocks into the air.<break time="2s"/>
Rivers flooded the earth.<break time="1.3s"/>

At last people believed<break time="2s"/> what Noah had told them.<break time="2s"/>
Some banged on<break time="2s"/> the ark door.<break time="2s"/>
But Noah could<break time="2s"/> not open the door.<break time="2s"/>
It was too late to<break time="2s"/> choose God and go in.<break time="2s"/>
