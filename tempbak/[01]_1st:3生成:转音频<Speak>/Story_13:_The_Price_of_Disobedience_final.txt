<break time="0.5s"/>After Adam and Eve ate the<break time="2s"/> fruit they began to feel afraid.<break time="2s"/>
The clothes of light that<break time="2s"/> God had given them were gone.<break time="2s"/>
That evening when God<break time="2s"/> came to the garden,<break time="2s"/>
Adam and Eve tried<break time="2s"/> to hide in some bushes.<break time="2s"/>

God called Adam and Eve.<break time="1.8s"/>
He asked,<break time="1s"/>
“Did you eat fruit from the forbidden tree?”<break time="2s"/> Adam told God that Eve made him do it.<break time="2s"/>
Eve blamed the snake.<break time="1.3s"/>
God was sad.<break time="1s"/>
But He spoke<break time="2s"/> kindly to His children.<break time="2s"/>
“You will have<break time="2s"/> to leave the garden.<break time="2s"/>
You and all<break time="2s"/> living things will die.<break time="2s"/>
” So Adam and Eve<break time="2s"/> sadly left their beautiful garden home.<break time="2s"/>
But God still loved them.<break time="1.8s"/>

The next morning angels came to tell them about<break time="2s"/> God’s love and a new plan He had made.<break time="2s"/>
“God says that He will give you another<break time="2s"/> chance to show Him that you love Him,<break time="2s"/>
” the angels said.<break time="1.3s"/>

“But how? How can<break time="2s"/> this be?” Adam asked.<break time="2s"/>

“Jesus,<break time="0.5s"/>
God’s Son,<break time="1s"/>
will die in your place.<break time="1.8s"/>
” Then the<break time="2s"/> angels told them more.<break time="2s"/>
“God will send His Son,<break time="1.8s"/>
Jesus,<break time="0.5s"/>
to this world<break time="2s"/> as a baby.<break time="2s"/>
He will grow up and<break time="2s"/> help people to know God better.<break time="2s"/>
He will die for the<break time="2s"/> wrong things you have done.<break time="2s"/>
God will raise Jesus up and<break time="2s"/> He will go back to heaven.<break time="2s"/>
One day He will come and<break time="2s"/> take His people to be with Him.<break time="2s"/>
