“Please don’t sell me! Don’t make me a<break time="2s"/> slave! Think of our dear father at home.<break time="2s"/>
” But they wouldn’t listen.<break time="1.8s"/>
They sold Joseph for<break time="2s"/> twenty pieces of silver.<break time="2s"/>

The men gave the<break time="2s"/> money to the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Then they grabbed Joseph and<break time="2s"/> chained him to some other slaves.<break time="2s"/>

“That’s the last we’ll<break time="2s"/> see of the dreamer,<break time="2s"/>
” the brothers said.<break time="1.3s"/>
They watched the<break time="2s"/> camels leave with Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

The caravan of<break time="2s"/> camels moved on.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was sad.<break time="1s"/>
How could he be a slave? He<break time="2s"/> had always had his father’s loving care.<break time="2s"/>

The camels went southward.<break time="1.3s"/>
After travelling several days,<break time="1.3s"/>
