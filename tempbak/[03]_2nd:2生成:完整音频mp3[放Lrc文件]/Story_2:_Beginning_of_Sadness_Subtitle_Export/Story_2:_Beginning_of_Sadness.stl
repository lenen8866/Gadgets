00:00:00:00,00:00:05:14,God made a special angel named Lucifer.
00:00:05:14,00:00:08:17,He was very beautiful.
00:00:08:17,00:00:15:00,He was a leader of the other angels in heaven.
00:00:15:00,00:00:17:12,He led the choir.
00:00:17:12,00:00:22:01,All the angels loved Lucifer.<br>
00:00:22:01,00:00:24:13,Little by little,pip install aeneas
00:00:24:13,00:00:31:05,Lucifer began to think about how special he was.
00:00:31:05,00:00:38:18,"I am the most beautiful and the wisest angel of all,
00:00:38:18,00:00:40:18," he said.<br>
00:00:40:18,00:00:46:27,God the Father and God the Son had a meeting.
00:00:46:27,00:00:55:10,"Why didnâ€™t they invite me to the meeting?" Lucifer thought.
00:00:55:10,00:00:59:04,"I am a very special angel.
00:00:59:04,00:01:04:27," Lucifer was jealous of God the Son.<br>
00:01:04:27,00:01:11:23,Then Lucifer started to talk to the other angels.
00:01:11:23,00:01:14:05,"God is not fair,
00:01:14:05,00:01:15:17," he said.
00:01:15:17,00:01:20:06,"He likes the Son better than me.
00:01:20:06,00:01:24:04," The angels were surprised.
00:01:24:04,00:01:26:07,They loved God.
00:01:26:07,00:01:27:24,But slowly,
00:01:27:24,00:01:33:12,some of the angels believed Lucifer.<br>
00:01:33:12,00:01:40:00,God the Father and the Son talked with Lucifer.
00:01:40:00,00:01:43:07,They tried to help him.
00:01:43:07,00:01:48:01,But Lucifer wanted to be like God.
00:01:48:01,00:01:54:19,A being God had made could not be like Him.<br>
00:01:54:19,00:01:55:22,At last,
00:01:55:22,00:02:01:03,God had to send Lucifer out of heaven.
00:02:01:03,00:02:05:22,Many of the angels went with him.
00:02:05:22,00:02:10:28,It was a very sad time in heaven.<br>
00:02:10:28,00:02:17:28,Now Lucifer chose to be an angel of lies and hate.
00:02:17:28,00:02:20:23,He was called Satan.
00:02:20:23,00:02:27:15,He wanted to do everything he could against God.
00:02:27:15,00:02:33:29,He wanted angels and people to be on his side.
00:02:33:29,00:02:38:09,He wants you to be on his side,
00:02:38:09,00:02:38:27,too.
00:02:38:27,00:02:43:03,We should not listen to Satan.
