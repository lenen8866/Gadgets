<break time="0.5s"/>It was still<break time="2s"/> the sixth day.<break time="2s"/>
Now it was time<break time="2s"/> for something very special.<break time="2s"/>
God said,<break time="1s"/>
"Let us make<break time="2s"/> man in our image.<break time="2s"/>
" The first man was to<break time="2s"/> be made to look like God.<break time="2s"/>

God kneeled down and created a man<break time="2s"/> out of the dust of the earth.<break time="2s"/>
He made the head,<break time="1.3s"/>
the body,<break time="1s"/>
and the arms and legs.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then came the most exciting thing!<break time="2s"/> God breathed air into man’s lungs,<break time="2s"/>
and the man was alive.<break time="1.8s"/>
He could walk<break time="2s"/> and talk and think.<break time="2s"/>
He opened his eyes<break time="2s"/> and looked at his Creator.<break time="2s"/>
God named the man Adam.<break time="1.8s"/>

God showed Adam the animals.<break time="1.8s"/>
He told Adam<break time="2s"/> to give them names.<break time="2s"/>

God knew that Adam would be lonely<break time="2s"/> if he had only the animals for friends.<break time="2s"/>
So God created a beautiful<break time="2s"/> woman to be with Adam.<break time="2s"/>
Her name was Eve.<break time="1.3s"/>
God dressed Adam and Eve<break time="2s"/> in lovely clothes of light.<break time="2s"/>
Adam and Eve were to take care of<break time="2s"/> everything in the beautiful garden home—the Garden of Eden.<break time="2s"/>
