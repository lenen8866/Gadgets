For three days Jonah ran along the<break time="2s"/> shore away from Nineveh and reached Joppa,<break time="2s"/>
a seaport.<break time="1s"/>
There he got into<break time="2s"/> a ship going to Tarshish,<break time="2s"/>
a faraway city.<break time="1s"/>

Being very tired from his three-day<break time="2s"/> trip of running away from God,<break time="2s"/>
he slept in a corner<break time="2s"/> at the bottom of the ship.<break time="2s"/>
The ship started sailing.<break time="1.3s"/>

Soon great winds<break time="2s"/> began to blow.<break time="2s"/>
The ship tossed<break time="2s"/> up and down.<break time="2s"/>
The captain was afraid.<break time="1.3s"/>

Everyone in the ship shouted<break time="2s"/> to their gods for help.<break time="2s"/>
They threw the cargo<break time="2s"/> out to lighten the ship.<break time="2s"/>

But Jonah was sound asleep.<break time="1.8s"/>
