Moses,<break time="0.5s"/>
I have chosen you to<break time="2s"/> lead the people out of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Go to the new Pharaoh and<break time="2s"/> tell him to let My people go.<break time="2s"/>

“Who am I?”<break time="2s"/> Moses asked God.<break time="2s"/>
“I am only<break time="2s"/> a poor shepherd.<break time="2s"/>
I am not the<break time="2s"/> one to help the people.<break time="2s"/>
