Noah and his family were kept busy<break time="2s"/> caring for all the animals and birds.<break time="2s"/>
Strong winds were blowing so<break time="2s"/> the water was drying up.<break time="2s"/>
The boat settled high on<break time="2s"/> the side of a mountain.<break time="2s"/>
More days and weeks<break time="2s"/> and months went by.<break time="2s"/>

One day Noah let a raven<break time="2s"/> fly out through the high window.<break time="2s"/>
The raven kept<break time="2s"/> flying back and forth,<break time="2s"/>
so Noah knew the<break time="2s"/> water was still very deep.<break time="2s"/>
After a week Noah<break time="2s"/> sent out a dove.<break time="2s"/>
It came right back.<break time="1.3s"/>
Noah took the dove<break time="2s"/> back into the ark.<break time="2s"/>

After another week Noah<break time="2s"/> sent out another dove.<break time="2s"/>
