<break time="0.5s"/>Joseph was glad when he<break time="2s"/> saw all the brothers come back.<break time="2s"/>
Now he knew that<break time="2s"/> his brothers had changed.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers bowed down on<break time="2s"/> the floor in front of Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
“We will all<break time="2s"/> be your slaves,<break time="2s"/>
” they said.<break time="1s"/>

“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
” said Joseph.<break time="1s"/>
“Only Benjamin has to stay.<break time="1.8s"/>
You can all go home.<break time="1.8s"/>

Then Judah came closer to Joseph<break time="2s"/> and kneeled in front of him.<break time="2s"/>
“If we go<break time="2s"/> back without Benjamin,<break time="2s"/>
our father will die,<break time="1.3s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“Please let me stay in<break time="2s"/> his place as your slave forever.<break time="2s"/>
Let him go<break time="2s"/> home to his father.<break time="2s"/>
” Joseph could<break time="2s"/> hardly keep from crying.<break time="2s"/>
This was Judah,<break time="1s"/>
the same brother who had told<break time="2s"/> the brothers to sell Joseph years ago.<break time="2s"/>
Now he was<break time="2s"/> unselfish and kind.<break time="2s"/>

“Leave the room,<break time="1s"/>
” Joseph said<break time="2s"/> to all his servants.<break time="2s"/>
When they had gone,<break time="1.3s"/>
Joseph cried out loud.<break time="1.3s"/>

“I am Joseph,<break time="1s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>

Joseph! How could this be Joseph?<break time="2s"/> “But he is speaking our language,<break time="2s"/>
” one of<break time="2s"/> the brothers said.<break time="2s"/>
“Now he will punish us<break time="2s"/> for what we did to him.<break time="2s"/>

But Joseph spoke<break time="2s"/> kindly to them.<break time="2s"/>
“Don’t be angry with<break time="2s"/> yourselves for selling me.<break time="2s"/>
This was God’s<break time="2s"/> plan for my life.<break time="2s"/>
God wanted me to teach the people<break time="2s"/> of Egypt about the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted me to<break time="2s"/> keep many people from starving.<break time="2s"/>
We have had two<break time="2s"/> bad years of famine.<break time="2s"/>
There will be five more<break time="2s"/> years when nothing can grow.<break time="2s"/>
Now go back and tell my<break time="2s"/> father that I am still alive.<break time="2s"/>
I want Father and all of<break time="2s"/> you to come to Egypt to live.<break time="2s"/>
Then you will<break time="2s"/> have food to eat.<break time="2s"/>
Come to Egypt and<break time="2s"/> bring everything that you have.<break time="2s"/>

Then Joseph put his arms around<break time="2s"/> Benjamin and they both cried for happiness.<break time="2s"/>
Then,<break time="0.5s"/>
one by one,<break time="1s"/>
Joseph went to each<break time="2s"/> brother and kissed him.<break time="2s"/>
Each one asked<break time="2s"/> Joseph to forgive him.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph was happy to forgive.<break time="1.8s"/>

Joseph sent wagons and<break time="2s"/> drivers with the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
The women and children and<break time="2s"/> Father Jacob could ride to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph sent food and<break time="2s"/> presents to his father too.<break time="2s"/>

When the brothers got home<break time="2s"/> they hurried into Father Jacob’s tent.<break time="2s"/>
“Joseph is alive,<break time="1s"/>
” they cried.<break time="1s"/>
“He is governor of Egypt.<break time="1.8s"/>
He wants you to come to Egypt right away!” Then the<break time="2s"/> brothers told Jacob what they had done to Joseph many years ago.<break time="2s"/>
They were very sorry.<break time="1.3s"/>
Jacob could not believe that<break time="2s"/> his son Joseph was still alive.<break time="2s"/>

“It is true,<break time="1s"/>
Father.<break time="0.5s"/>
See all the wagons<break time="2s"/> Joseph sent from Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He wants you to<break time="2s"/> have a good trip.<break time="2s"/>
Look at all the<break time="2s"/> presents he sent you.<break time="2s"/>

At last Jacob believed that his son was<break time="2s"/> really alive! He couldn’t wait to see him again.<break time="2s"/>

And so the happy day came<break time="2s"/> when Jacob and his much loved son,<break time="2s"/>
Joseph,<break time="0.5s"/>
were together again.<break time="1s"/>
When Jacob saw Joseph,<break time="1.3s"/>
he said,<break time="1s"/>
“I have seen you.<break time="1.3s"/>
You are still alive.<break time="1.3s"/>
Now I am<break time="2s"/> ready to die.<break time="2s"/>
” But Jacob<break time="2s"/> did not die.<break time="2s"/>
He lived a<break time="2s"/> long time after this.<break time="2s"/>
The years he lived in Egypt near<break time="2s"/> Joseph were the happiest years of his life.<break time="2s"/>
