There was a
 bad famine in Egypt.
People in other
 countries were having famine,
too.
They found out there
 was food in Egypt.
So they came to
 buy food from Joseph.@@@

In Jacob’s home
 there was famine,
too.
“Go to Egypt,
” Jacob said
 to the brothers.
“Go right away
 and buy food.
Your wives and
 children are hungry.
” Jacob would
 not let Benjamin go.@@@

The ten men took their money and their
 donkeys and started on their way to Egypt.
As they traveled
 they talked about Joseph.
They wondered if
 he was still alive.
They were sorry for what
 they had done to their brother.@@@

When Joseph’s ten
 brothers got to Egypt,
they went to the governor
 of Egypt to buy food.
They did not know that
 the governor was their brother Joseph.
But when Joseph saw them,
he knew them right away.
They bowed down
 in front of him,
and he remembered his dreams.
Joseph saw that Benjamin
 was not with the brothers.
Had they done
 something bad to him,
too? He thought
 about his father.
Was Jacob still alive? Joseph wanted to
 ask his brothers about his father and Benjamin,
but he did not.
First,
he wanted to find out
 if the brothers were still unkind.@@@

“Where are you
 from?” Joseph asked.@@@

“We come from Canaan,
” they said.@@@

“You are spies,
” Joseph said.
“You have come to see what our country
 is like so you can fight against us.@@@

“No,
we are not spies,
” the brothers said.
“Our father lives in Canaan.
Our youngest brother is there,
too.
One brother is gone.@@@

Joseph was very happy to hear that
 his father and Benjamin were still alive,
but he acted angry.
“No,
you are spies,
” he said again.
“You cannot leave Egypt
 until your brother comes here.
Then I will know
 that you are not lying.
One of you may go
 home and get your brother.
The rest of you
 must go to prison.@@@

After three days Joseph took
 his brothers out of prison.
He knew that his father and
 all the families needed to have food.
“You may go home,
” he said.
“Only one of you
 will stay in prison.
When you come back
 bring your brother with you.
Then I will know that
 you are telling the truth.@@@

The brothers talked
 to each other.
They did not know that
 Joseph could understand their language.
“We are having all this trouble
 because of what we did to Joseph,
” one brother said.@@@

“I told you not
 to hurt the boy,
” Reuben said,
“but you wouldn’t
 listen to me.@@@

Joseph had to leave the
 room because he was crying.
He wanted so much to
 tell the brothers who he was,
but first he wanted to
 see how they treated Benjamin.@@@

Guards took one brother,
Simeon,
to prison.
Joseph’s servants filled the
 brothers’ sacks with grain.
He told one servant to put all of the brothers’
 money back in their sacks on top of the grain.
