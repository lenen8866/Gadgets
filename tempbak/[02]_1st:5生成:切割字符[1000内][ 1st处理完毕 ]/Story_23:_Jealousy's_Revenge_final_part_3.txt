When he got to Shechem<break time="2s"/> where his brothers had gone,<break time="2s"/>
they were not there.<break time="1.3s"/>
He looked and looked,<break time="1.3s"/>
but he could<break time="2s"/> not find them.<break time="2s"/>
A man saw Joseph<break time="2s"/> walking around in a field.<break time="2s"/>
He told Joseph that his<break time="2s"/> brothers had gone to Dothan.<break time="2s"/>

Poor Joseph! He was so tired!<break time="2s"/> But he must find his brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Father would be waiting<break time="2s"/> to hear how they were.<break time="2s"/>
The sun was hot.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was hungry and thirsty.<break time="1.8s"/>
As he walked he hoped it would<break time="2s"/> not take too long to get to Dothan.<break time="2s"/>

At last he saw<break time="2s"/> some tents far away.<break time="2s"/>
He walked faster.<break time="1s"/>
