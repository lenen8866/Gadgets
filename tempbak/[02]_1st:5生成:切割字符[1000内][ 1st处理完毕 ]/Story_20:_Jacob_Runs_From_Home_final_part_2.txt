They did not know that they<break time="2s"/> would never see each other again.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob was sad and<break time="2s"/> afraid as he hurried away.<break time="2s"/>
Soon it was dark,<break time="1.3s"/>
but he kept going.<break time="1.3s"/>
He was afraid that Esau would<break time="2s"/> come after him and kill him.<break time="2s"/>
He knew he had done<break time="2s"/> wrong to lie to his father.<break time="2s"/>
He should have trusted God<break time="2s"/> to take care of the birthright.<break time="2s"/>

“I am alone<break time="2s"/> without Mother or Father,<break time="2s"/>
” he cried.<break time="1s"/>
“Even God is not<break time="2s"/> with me any more.<break time="2s"/>
” All the next<break time="2s"/> day he hurried on.<break time="2s"/>
He didn’t want<break time="2s"/> anyone to see him.<break time="2s"/>
