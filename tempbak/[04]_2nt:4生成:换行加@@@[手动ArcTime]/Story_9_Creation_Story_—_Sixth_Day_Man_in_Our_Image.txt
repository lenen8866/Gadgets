It was still
 the sixth day.
Now it was time
 for something very special.
God said,
"Let us make
 man in our image.
" The first man was to
 be made to look like God.@@@

God kneeled down and created a man
 out of the dust of the earth.
He made the head,
the body,
and the arms and legs.
Then came the most exciting thing!
 God breathed air into man’s lungs,
and the man was alive.
He could walk
 and talk and think.
He opened his eyes
 and looked at his Creator.
God named the man Adam.@@@

God showed Adam the animals.
He told Adam
 to give them names.@@@

God knew that Adam would be lonely
 if he had only the animals for friends.
So God created a beautiful
 woman to be with Adam.
Her name was Eve.
God dressed Adam and Eve
 in lovely clothes of light.
Adam and Eve were to take care of
 everything in the beautiful garden home—the Garden of Eden.
