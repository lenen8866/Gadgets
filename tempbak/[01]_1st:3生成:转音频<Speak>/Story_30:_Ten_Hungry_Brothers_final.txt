<break time="0.5s"/>There was a<break time="2s"/> bad famine in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
People in other<break time="2s"/> countries were having famine,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
They found out there<break time="2s"/> was food in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
So they came to<break time="2s"/> buy food from Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

In Jacob’s home<break time="2s"/> there was famine,<break time="2s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
“Go to Egypt,<break time="1s"/>
” Jacob said<break time="2s"/> to the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
“Go right away<break time="2s"/> and buy food.<break time="2s"/>
Your wives and<break time="2s"/> children are hungry.<break time="2s"/>
” Jacob would<break time="2s"/> not let Benjamin go.<break time="2s"/>

The ten men took their money and their<break time="2s"/> donkeys and started on their way to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
As they traveled<break time="2s"/> they talked about Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
They wondered if<break time="2s"/> he was still alive.<break time="2s"/>
They were sorry for what<break time="2s"/> they had done to their brother.<break time="2s"/>

When Joseph’s ten<break time="2s"/> brothers got to Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
they went to the governor<break time="2s"/> of Egypt to buy food.<break time="2s"/>
They did not know that<break time="2s"/> the governor was their brother Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
But when Joseph saw them,<break time="1.8s"/>
he knew them right away.<break time="1.8s"/>
They bowed down<break time="2s"/> in front of him,<break time="2s"/>
and he remembered his dreams.<break time="1.8s"/>
Joseph saw that Benjamin<break time="2s"/> was not with the brothers.<break time="2s"/>
Had they done<break time="2s"/> something bad to him,<break time="2s"/>
too? He thought<break time="2s"/> about his father.<break time="2s"/>
Was Jacob still alive? Joseph wanted to<break time="2s"/> ask his brothers about his father and Benjamin,<break time="2s"/>
but he did not.<break time="1.3s"/>
First,<break time="0.5s"/>
he wanted to find out<break time="2s"/> if the brothers were still unkind.<break time="2s"/>

“Where are you<break time="2s"/> from?” Joseph asked.<break time="2s"/>

“We come from Canaan,<break time="1.3s"/>
” they said.<break time="1s"/>

“You are spies,<break time="1s"/>
” Joseph said.<break time="1s"/>
“You have come to see what our country<break time="2s"/> is like so you can fight against us.<break time="2s"/>

“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
we are not spies,<break time="1.3s"/>
” the brothers said.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Our father lives in Canaan.<break time="1.8s"/>
Our youngest brother is there,<break time="1.8s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
One brother is gone.<break time="1.3s"/>

Joseph was very happy to hear that<break time="2s"/> his father and Benjamin were still alive,<break time="2s"/>
but he acted angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
you are spies,<break time="1s"/>
” he said again.<break time="1.3s"/>
“You cannot leave Egypt<break time="2s"/> until your brother comes here.<break time="2s"/>
Then I will know<break time="2s"/> that you are not lying.<break time="2s"/>
One of you may go<break time="2s"/> home and get your brother.<break time="2s"/>
The rest of you<break time="2s"/> must go to prison.<break time="2s"/>

After three days Joseph took<break time="2s"/> his brothers out of prison.<break time="2s"/>
He knew that his father and<break time="2s"/> all the families needed to have food.<break time="2s"/>
“You may go home,<break time="1.3s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“Only one of you<break time="2s"/> will stay in prison.<break time="2s"/>
When you come back<break time="2s"/> bring your brother with you.<break time="2s"/>
Then I will know that<break time="2s"/> you are telling the truth.<break time="2s"/>

The brothers talked<break time="2s"/> to each other.<break time="2s"/>
They did not know that<break time="2s"/> Joseph could understand their language.<break time="2s"/>
“We are having all this trouble<break time="2s"/> because of what we did to Joseph,<break time="2s"/>
” one brother said.<break time="1.3s"/>

“I told you not<break time="2s"/> to hurt the boy,<break time="2s"/>
” Reuben said,<break time="1s"/>
“but you wouldn’t<break time="2s"/> listen to me.<break time="2s"/>

Joseph had to leave the<break time="2s"/> room because he was crying.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted so much to<break time="2s"/> tell the brothers who he was,<break time="2s"/>
but first he wanted to<break time="2s"/> see how they treated Benjamin.<break time="2s"/>

Guards took one brother,<break time="1.3s"/>
Simeon,<break time="0.5s"/>
to prison.<break time="1s"/>
Joseph’s servants filled the<break time="2s"/> brothers’ sacks with grain.<break time="2s"/>
He told one servant to put all of the brothers’<break time="2s"/> money back in their sacks on top of the grain.<break time="2s"/>
