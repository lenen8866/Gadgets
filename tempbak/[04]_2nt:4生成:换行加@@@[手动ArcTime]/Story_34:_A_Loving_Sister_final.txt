It was very
 early in the morning.
It was dark.
It was so dark that
 some stars were still shining.
Jochabed held her little
 son Moses in her arms.
Miriam carried the basket.@@@

They opened the door
 and left their little house.
They tiptoed through the
 narrow streets of the village.
They walked quietly
 across a field.
Then they walked along the
 side of the River Nile.@@@

“This is a good place,
” Mother whispered.
They stopped.
Miriam opened the basket.
Mother put the sleeping
 baby on the pillow inside.
Then Mother and Miriam
 prayed to God together.@@@

“Please keep our baby safe,
” Miriam prayed.
Mother put the basket boat in the
 river and pushed it away from the bank.
It rocked between the reeds.@@@

“I must go now,
Miriam,
” said Mother.
“God will keep
 you both safe.
” Mother kissed
 Miriam and hurried away.
But the children
 were not alone.
God had sent angels
 to watch over them.@@@

Daylight came.
Time went by.
Miriam kept watching the
 little basket with its secret.
She heard the
 croak of a frog.
She did not know that at that very moment Pharaoh’s
 daughter was coming with her maids to bathe in the river.
She did not know that angels were guiding the princess
 to the very spot where the basket was rocking gently.@@@

Suddenly Miriam heard voices! Were soldiers
 near? Miriam’s heart beat very fast.
She listened.
No,
not soldiers.
She heard happy women’s voices.
Then she saw the beautiful princess
 and her maids walking to the river.
Miriam watched them from among
 the reeds where she was standing.@@@

Miriam was afraid.
But the princess
 had a kind face.
Miriam saw the princess pointing
 to the little basket boat.
“What is that?” the
 princess asked her maids.
“Go bring it to me.@@@

One of the maids
 waded out into the water.
She brought the
 basket to the shore.
Miriam held her breath as she watched
 the princess lift the cover and look inside.@@@

The baby woke up.
He reached up his little
 arms and started to cry.
Miriam heard her brother cry.
