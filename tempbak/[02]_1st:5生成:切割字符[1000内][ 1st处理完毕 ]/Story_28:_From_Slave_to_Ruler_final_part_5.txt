He was next to the king<break time="2s"/> in power! He was governor of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>

All in one day it had<break time="2s"/> happened! In the morning Joseph woke up.<break time="2s"/>
It seemed like it was going<break time="2s"/> to be just another day in prison.<break time="2s"/>
That night he was in a<break time="2s"/> beautiful room in the kingâ€™s palace.<break time="2s"/>
He stood by his window<break time="2s"/> looking out on the lovely gardens.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph did not forget to<break time="2s"/> thank God for His loving care.<break time="2s"/>
