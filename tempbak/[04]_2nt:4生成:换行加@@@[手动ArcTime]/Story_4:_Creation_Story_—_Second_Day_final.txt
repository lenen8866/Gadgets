Godâ€™s plan was to create
 people to live on the earth.
He wanted them
 to be His friends.
But first God would create
 a beautiful world for their home.
He would give
 them everything they needed.
He wanted them
 to be very happy.
On the first
 day He made light.
People would not be able to
 see if they did not have light.
On the second day,
He created something else for
 the people He would make.@@@

God spoke,
"Let the waters rise to
 make a big space of sky.
" Some water went up.
This water made the clouds.
He filled the
 space with air.
People would need
 air to live.
God planned to make plants
 and animals for the people.
These would need
 air to live,
too.
That is why God created
 air on the second day.@@@

Evening came.
The second day was done.
God looked at the
 big space filled with air.
He saw that
 it was very good.
God liked what
 He had made.
He knew the people He
 would create would like it,
too.
