“What a nice
 baby!” the princess said.
She picked Moses up
 and wiped away his tears.
“You must be one
 of the Israelite babies,
” she said.@@@

“The princess loves our baby,
too,
” Miriam thought as she
 watched the princess hug the baby.@@@

“What are you going to do
 with him?” one of the maids asked.@@@

“I’m going to keep him,
” said the princess.
“No one is going
 to hurt this child.@@@

“Her father is King Pharaoh,
” Miriam thought.
“He won’t like this baby.@@@

Right then Miriam
 knew what to do.
God was helping her.
She came out
 from her hiding place.
Her heart was
 beating very fast.
She was afraid,
but she walked right up
 to the princess and bowed.@@@

“Do you want me to go and find one of the
 Israelite women to take care of the baby for you?” she asked.
The princess looked at Miriam.@@@

“Go,
” she said to Miriam.
Miriam didn’t know that
 she could run so fast.
In a short time
 Mother stood before the princess.
She had run fast,
too.@@@

“Take this baby home and
 take care of him for me,
” the princess said.
“I will pay
 you for it.
” Then she smiled at Jochabed and
 put Moses into his very own Mother’s arms.
