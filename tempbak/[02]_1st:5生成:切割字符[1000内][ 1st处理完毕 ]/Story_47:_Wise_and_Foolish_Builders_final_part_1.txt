<break time="0.5s"/>Jesus told many stories to help<break time="2s"/> people understand how to be God’s children.<break time="2s"/>
One of these stories<break time="2s"/> was about building houses.<break time="2s"/>

Long ago a very wise<break time="2s"/> man decided to build a house.<break time="2s"/>
He searched here and there looking<break time="2s"/> for the best place to build.<break time="2s"/>
At last he<break time="2s"/> found a good place.<break time="2s"/>

“I’ve found the spot on<break time="2s"/> which I shall build my house,<break time="2s"/>
” he told his friend.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Where?” his friend<break time="2s"/> wanted to know.<break time="2s"/>

“On the hill up there.<break time="1.8s"/>
” he pointed.<break time="1s"/>

“Why so far<break time="2s"/> away?” his friend asked.<break time="2s"/>
“Why don’t you build beside me here<break time="2s"/> on the sand? It would be much easier.<break time="2s"/>
