<break time="0.5s"/>The people walked<break time="2s"/> for two days.<break time="2s"/>
They were tired,<break time="1s"/>
but they were free.<break time="1.3s"/>
And they were happy.<break time="1.3s"/>

Night was coming again.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was time<break time="2s"/> to stop walking.<break time="2s"/>
It was time to rest.<break time="1.8s"/>
Fathers put up tents.<break time="1.3s"/>
Mothers cooked food.<break time="1s"/>
The people were<break time="2s"/> ready to sleep.<break time="2s"/>
The sun went down.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was getting dark.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was getting cold,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

Then something wonderful happened.<break time="1.3s"/>
Everyone stopped what<break time="2s"/> they were doing.<break time="2s"/>
They looked up<break time="2s"/> into the sky.<break time="2s"/>
There was a long<break time="2s"/> cloud like a pillar.<break time="2s"/>
As the sky got darker,<break time="1.8s"/>
the cloud got brighter.<break time="1.3s"/>
Soon it was<break time="2s"/> a pillar of fire.<break time="2s"/>
There was light<break time="2s"/> in the camp.<break time="2s"/>
It was not cold<break time="2s"/> and not dark anymore.<break time="2s"/>

“What is it?”<break time="2s"/> the people asked.<break time="2s"/>

Moses knew.<break time="1s"/>
He told the people,<break time="1.3s"/>
“God has put<break time="2s"/> the cloud there.<break time="2s"/>
He will take<break time="2s"/> care of us.<break time="2s"/>
He is our leader.<break time="1.3s"/>
We will follow the cloud.<break time="1.8s"/>

The next day the<break time="2s"/> cloud started to move.<break time="2s"/>
The cloud gave shade from<break time="2s"/> the desert sun in the daytime.<break time="2s"/>
Everyone packed up their tents<break time="2s"/> and food and followed the cloud.<break time="2s"/>
It led them on<break time="2s"/> and on until night came.<break time="2s"/>
They stopped when<break time="2s"/> the cloud stopped.<break time="2s"/>

The people put up their tents<break time="2s"/> in a valley between two mountains.<break time="2s"/>
The Red Sea was<break time="2s"/> in front of them.<break time="2s"/>
The people were<break time="2s"/> hungry and tired.<break time="2s"/>
But what was that noise? Hundreds<break time="2s"/> of chariots and soldiers were coming.<break time="2s"/>
They were coming<break time="2s"/> closer and closer.<break time="2s"/>

After the Israelites<break time="2s"/> had left Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
Pharaoh and his men were sorry<break time="2s"/> they had let the people go.<break time="2s"/>
Pharaoh needed help to<break time="2s"/> make bricks for his buildings.<break time="2s"/>
He decided to bring<break time="2s"/> the people back to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He took his chariots and soldiers<break time="2s"/> and went after the people of Israel.<break time="2s"/>
He and his army hurried very fast<break time="2s"/> and found the camp by the sea.<break time="2s"/>

“The Israelites are trapped,<break time="1.3s"/>
” Pharaoh said.<break time="1s"/>
“They have no<break time="2s"/> place to go.<break time="2s"/>
They will have to<break time="2s"/> come back with us.<break time="2s"/>
This will be easy.<break time="1.3s"/>

But when Pharaoh and his soldiers<break time="2s"/> got very close to the Israelite's camp,<break time="2s"/>
they had to stop.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was dark,<break time="1s"/>
and there was fog too.<break time="1.8s"/>
The army would have<break time="2s"/> to wait till morning light.<break time="2s"/>

It was not dark<break time="2s"/> in the camp of Israel.<break time="2s"/>
The pillar of fire made<break time="2s"/> the camp bright on their side.<break time="2s"/>

When the people prayed<break time="2s"/> to God for help,<break time="2s"/>
some of them were afraid.<break time="1.8s"/>
Some of them<break time="2s"/> were angry at Moses.<break time="2s"/>
“Why did you bring<break time="2s"/> us here?” they asked.<break time="2s"/>
“It was better to<break time="2s"/> be slaves in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>

Moses was sorry that the<break time="2s"/> people did not trust God.<break time="2s"/>
He told them<break time="2s"/> not to be afraid.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“Stand still.<break time="1s"/>
God will take<break time="2s"/> care of us.<break time="2s"/>
