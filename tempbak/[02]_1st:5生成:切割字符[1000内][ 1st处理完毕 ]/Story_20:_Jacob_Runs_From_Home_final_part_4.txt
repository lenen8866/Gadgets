Jacob saw the bottom of a<break time="2s"/> ladder on the ground right beside him.<break time="2s"/>
It went up,<break time="1s"/>
up until the top<break time="2s"/> of the ladder reached heaven.<break time="2s"/>
Beautiful angels were going<break time="2s"/> up and down the ladder.<break time="2s"/>
At the very<break time="2s"/> top was God Himself.<break time="2s"/>
God talked to<break time="2s"/> Jacob in the dream.<break time="2s"/>
He said,<break time="1s"/>
“I am with you.<break time="1.3s"/>
I will take care<break time="2s"/> of you wherever you go.<break time="2s"/>
I will bring you<break time="2s"/> back to this land.<break time="2s"/>
I will not leave you.<break time="1.8s"/>

Jacob woke up happy.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Surely the Lord is in this<break time="2s"/> place and I didn’t know it.<break time="2s"/>
God is with me.<break time="1.3s"/>
He has forgiven my sins.<break time="1.8s"/>
