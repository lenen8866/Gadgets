Rebekah loved Jacob best.<break time="1.3s"/>

In those times,<break time="1s"/>
in each family,<break time="1s"/>
the first boy born<break time="2s"/> was to get the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
That meant that he would be the<break time="2s"/> one to help his family worship God.<break time="2s"/>
Esau,<break time="0.5s"/>
the firstborn,<break time="1s"/>
did not care<break time="2s"/> much about the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob,<break time="0.5s"/>
the younger son,<break time="1s"/>
often wished that he<break time="2s"/> could have the birthright.<break time="2s"/>

The boys grew<break time="2s"/> to be young men.<break time="2s"/>
One day Jacob was<break time="2s"/> making some good food.<break time="2s"/>
He was cooking some lentils.<break time="1.8s"/>
Esau came back from<break time="2s"/> hunting and was very hungry.<break time="2s"/>
