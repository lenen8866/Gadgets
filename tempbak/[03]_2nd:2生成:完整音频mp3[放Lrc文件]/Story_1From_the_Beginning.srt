1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Long,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,580
long ago,

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,910
there were no

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,340
 boys or girls.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,130
There were no

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,840
 mothers or fathers.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,680
There was no earth

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,400
 with rivers and trees.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,720
No one was there,

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,030
but God.@@@

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,100
God has always been.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,430
God will always be.

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,010
There is God the Father.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,600
There is God the Son.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,050
We call Him Jesus.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,120
And there is

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,220
 God the Holy Spirit.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,550
There is one

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,390
 God but three persons.@@@

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,610
God family is a

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,580
 little like our families.

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,930
A family is one family,

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,520
but there are different

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,480
 people in the family.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,940
There is a

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,650
 father and a mother.

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,110
And there are children.@@@

28
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,330
God made many angels to

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,430
 live with Him in heaven,

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,630
and to work with Him.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,470
He made this world

32
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,920
 and put people in it.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,280
God wanted angels and

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,590
 people to be His friends.
