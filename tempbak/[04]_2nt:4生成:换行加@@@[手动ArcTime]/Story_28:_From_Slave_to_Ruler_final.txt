“Pharaoh wants to see
 me?” Joseph was surprised.
But when the king calls,
you obey! Joseph shaved and dressed in
 the clean clothes they brought to him.
He combed his hair nicely.
There was a
 prayer in his heart.
He was ready.@@@

Joseph followed the king’s servant
 through the long palace halls.
At last he stood before
 Pharaoh seated on his beautiful throne.
Joseph knew how to act and
 what to do in a palace.
He had learned these things
 when he worked for Potiphar.
He kneeled before the king.
Then he stood up
 tall in front of him.@@@

“I had some
 very strange dreams,
” Pharaoh told Joseph.
“No one can tell
 me what they mean.@@@

“I cannot tell you,
” Joseph said,
“but my God,
the God of heaven,
can give Pharaoh the
 meaning of his dreams.@@@

After Pharaoh told
 Joseph his dreams,
God helped Joseph to
 know what they meant.@@@

“Both dreams mean
 the same thing,
” Joseph said.
“The seven fat cows and the seven good ears of
 grain mean that there will be seven good years in Egypt.
There will be enough rain
 and everything will grow well.@@@

“The seven skinny cows and the seven poor
 ears of corn mean that after the good years,
seven very bad
 years will come.
No rain will fall.
Nothing will grow.
There will be a famine.@@@

Pharaoh was afraid.
Seven years of famine in Egypt? No food
 could grow! All the people and animals would die.@@@

Joseph wanted to
 help the king.
He said,
“Oh,
king,
I think you should choose
 a wise man in Egypt.
He should start
 working right away.
He should build big storehouses to put
 a lot of food for the bad years.
Then when that time comes
 there will be food for all.@@@

Pharaoh felt better now.
This young man
 knew what to do.
The king and his helpers chose Joseph
 to be the one to store up food.@@@

“No one is
 wiser than you.
I am making you
 the governor of Egypt,
” the king told Joseph.
“Only I,
Pharaoh,
will be higher than you.
You will be the one to keep the
 people of Egypt from starving when the famine comes.@@@

Joseph couldn’t believe it.
Had he heard Pharaoh right? He
 was not a slave any more.
He did not have
 to go back to prison.
He was next to the king
 in power! He was governor of Egypt.@@@

All in one day it had
 happened! In the morning Joseph woke up.
It seemed like it was going
 to be just another day in prison.
That night he was in a
 beautiful room in the king’s palace.
He stood by his window
 looking out on the lovely gardens.
Joseph did not forget to
 thank God for His loving care.
