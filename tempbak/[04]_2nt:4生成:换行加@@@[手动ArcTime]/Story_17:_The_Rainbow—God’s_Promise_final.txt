Noah’s family was
 safe inside the ark.
For forty days and
 nights the rain poured down.
It came harder and harder—faster
 and faster! The water got deeper.
Noah felt the big boat
 lift as it began to float.
The water covered
 even the highest mountain.@@@

At last the rain stopped.
Big waves rocked the
 ark back and forth.
Days and weeks
 and months went by.
Little by little the
 flood waters went down.
God sent angels to guide the boat
 to a place between some high mountains.
The water was quieter there.@@@

Noah and his family were kept busy
 caring for all the animals and birds.
Strong winds were blowing so
 the water was drying up.
The boat settled high on
 the side of a mountain.
More days and weeks
 and months went by.@@@

One day Noah let a raven
 fly out through the high window.
The raven kept
 flying back and forth,
so Noah knew the
 water was still very deep.
After a week Noah
 sent out a dove.
It came right back.
Noah took the dove
 back into the ark.@@@

After another week Noah
 sent out another dove.
It came back with
 a leaf in its beak.
Then the family knew that plants
 were beginning to grow on the earth.
Soon God would
 open the door.
After another week Noah
 sent the dove out again.
It did not come back.
It had found a
 resting place and food.@@@

After more time had passed,
Noah heard God’s voice.
“It is time to
 come out of the ark,
” He said.
“Bring out your family and
 all the animals and birds.@@@

God sent His angel
 to open the door.
Slowly the big
 door swung open.
Noah and his family walked out of the
 ark into the fresh air and warm sunshine.
They had been in the
 ark for a long time.@@@

All the animals came
 out of the ark.
They were happy to be
 able to run and jump.
The birds went flying away,
high in the sky.@@@

Soon the animals
 had gone away.
But some animals,
like cats and dogs,
sheep and goats,
stayed near the people.@@@

The first thing Noah’s family did when they came out
 of the ark was to thank God for keeping them safe.
Then they saw a bright
 rainbow shining across the sky.
They had never
 seen a rainbow before.
God told them the rainbow
 was a promise for them.
He would not send another
 flood to cover the whole earth.
They knew God loved
 and cared for them.@@@

The family started
 to make their homes.
Soon grass and
 flowers began to grow.
The world became beautiful again.
