<break time="0.5s"/>“Pharaoh wants to see<break time="2s"/> me?” Joseph was surprised.<break time="2s"/>
But when the king calls,<break time="1.8s"/>
you obey! Joseph shaved and dressed in<break time="2s"/> the clean clothes they brought to him.<break time="2s"/>
He combed his hair nicely.<break time="1.8s"/>
There was a<break time="2s"/> prayer in his heart.<break time="2s"/>
He was ready.<break time="1s"/>

Joseph followed the king’s servant<break time="2s"/> through the long palace halls.<break time="2s"/>
At last he stood before<break time="2s"/> Pharaoh seated on his beautiful throne.<break time="2s"/>
Joseph knew how to act and<break time="2s"/> what to do in a palace.<break time="2s"/>
He had learned these things<break time="2s"/> when he worked for Potiphar.<break time="2s"/>
He kneeled before the king.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then he stood up<break time="2s"/> tall in front of him.<break time="2s"/>
