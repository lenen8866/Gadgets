Farther down the street he<break time="2s"/> saw a big sycamore tree.<break time="2s"/>
He ran ahead of<break time="2s"/> the crowd to the tree.<break time="2s"/>
He climbed out on a branch that hung<break time="2s"/> over the place where Jesus would soon walk.<break time="2s"/>

Just a few more steps<break time="2s"/> and Jesus would pass by.<break time="2s"/>
Suddenly Jesus stopped.<break time="1s"/>
He looked right<break time="2s"/> up into Zacchaeus’ face,<break time="2s"/>
and called,<break time="1s"/>
“Zacchaeus,<break time="0.5s"/>
come down! Hurry! I would like<break time="2s"/> to visit you in your house today.<break time="2s"/>
” Shaking with excitement,<break time="1.3s"/>

He led the<break time="2s"/> way toward his house.<break time="2s"/>

He told Jesus,<break time="1s"/>
“Sir,<break time="0.5s"/>
