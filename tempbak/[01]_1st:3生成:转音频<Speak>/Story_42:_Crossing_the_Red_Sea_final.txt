<break time="0.5s"/>It was still night when God<break time="2s"/> told Moses it was time to go.<break time="2s"/>
Moses told the<break time="2s"/> people to get ready.<break time="2s"/>
They packed up<break time="2s"/> their things again.<break time="2s"/>
All the people and<break time="2s"/> animals got into line.<break time="2s"/>
But where could they go? The<break time="2s"/> sea was in front of them.<break time="2s"/>
The mountains were<break time="2s"/> on both sides.<break time="2s"/>
Pharaoh and his<break time="2s"/> army were behind them.<break time="2s"/>

God told Moses,<break time="1s"/>
“Lift up your rod and<break time="2s"/> put it out over the water.<break time="2s"/>
” Moses obeyed.<break time="1s"/>
Right then a<break time="2s"/> wind began to blow.<break time="2s"/>
It blew very hard.<break time="1.3s"/>
The water in the<break time="2s"/> Red Sea began to divide.<break time="2s"/>
It piled up higher<break time="2s"/> and higher on each side.<break time="2s"/>
The light from the cloud<break time="2s"/> of fire shone on the waves.<break time="2s"/>
There was a road<break time="2s"/> between the walls of water.<break time="2s"/>
You could not see the end of<break time="2s"/> the long road through the Red Sea.<break time="2s"/>

“Go forward,<break time="1s"/>
” Moses shouted.<break time="1s"/>
The people and<break time="2s"/> animals started to walk.<break time="2s"/>
Right down to the path<break time="2s"/> through the sea they went.<break time="2s"/>
Children looked with wonder at<break time="2s"/> the high walls of water.<break time="2s"/>
The great God<break time="2s"/> of heaven loved them.<break time="2s"/>
He was saving them<break time="2s"/> from Pharaoh and his army.<break time="2s"/>
On and on they marched.<break time="1.8s"/>
They kept going until<break time="2s"/> they reached the other side.<break time="2s"/>
When the last person<break time="2s"/> went down the path,<break time="2s"/>
the cloud of<break time="2s"/> fire followed slowly.<break time="2s"/>

While the Israelites were walking,<break time="1.8s"/>
Pharaoh and his<break time="2s"/> soldiers were sleeping,<break time="2s"/>
but the guards were awake.<break time="1.8s"/>
They heard tramping feet.<break time="1.3s"/>
What was happening? There was no<break time="2s"/> place for the people to go.<break time="2s"/>

The guards cried out,<break time="1.3s"/>
“The Israelites are<break time="2s"/> getting away! Follow them.<break time="2s"/>
” It was very dark<break time="2s"/> and foggy in Pharaoh's camp.<break time="2s"/>
The Egyptian soldiers didn't<break time="2s"/> know where they were going.<break time="2s"/>
They followed the sound<break time="2s"/> of voices and tramping feet.<break time="2s"/>
Horses pulled the big chariots along<break time="2s"/> the path in the Red Sea.<break time="2s"/>

When the fog went away,<break time="1.8s"/>
the soldiers saw the big walls<break time="2s"/> of water on each side of them.<break time="2s"/>
The wheels of the big chariots<break time="2s"/> were beginning to sink in the sand.<break time="2s"/>
Pharaoh's army was very frightened.<break time="1.8s"/>
They tried to turn around,<break time="1.8s"/>
but it was too late.<break time="1.8s"/>
“The Israelites' God is<break time="2s"/> fighting for them!” they said.<break time="2s"/>
And it was true.<break time="1.3s"/>

God looked down sadly<break time="2s"/> at Pharaoh and his soldiers.<break time="2s"/>
He had tried to help them<break time="2s"/> know that He was the true God.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them<break time="2s"/> to love Him,<break time="2s"/>
but they would not.<break time="1.3s"/>

“Put out your rod,<break time="1.3s"/>
” God told Moses.<break time="1.3s"/>
Moses obeyed and the waters of the Red<break time="2s"/> Sea came crashing down on Pharaoh and his army.<break time="2s"/>
Not one of God's<break time="2s"/> people was hurt or lost.<break time="2s"/>
They all stood safe<break time="2s"/> on the other shore.<break time="2s"/>

Moses made up a song.<break time="1.8s"/>
The men sang<break time="2s"/> the song with Moses.<break time="2s"/>
It was a song of thanks and<break time="2s"/> praise to the great God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>

Moses' sister,<break time="1s"/>
Miriam,<break time="0.5s"/>
took her tambourine and<break time="2s"/> began to play and sing.<break time="2s"/>
The women sang with her.<break time="1.8s"/>

“I will sing<break time="2s"/> unto the Lord,<break time="2s"/>
” they sang,<break time="1s"/>
“The horse and his rider<break time="2s"/> hath He thrown into the sea.<break time="2s"/>
