Then Mother and Miriam<break time="2s"/> prayed to God together.<break time="2s"/>

“Please keep our baby safe,<break time="1.8s"/>
” Miriam prayed.<break time="1s"/>
Mother put the basket boat in the<break time="2s"/> river and pushed it away from the bank.<break time="2s"/>
It rocked between the reeds.<break time="1.8s"/>

“I must go now,<break time="1.3s"/>
Miriam,<break time="0.5s"/>
” said Mother.<break time="1s"/>
“God will keep<break time="2s"/> you both safe.<break time="2s"/>
” Mother kissed<break time="2s"/> Miriam and hurried away.<break time="2s"/>
But the children<break time="2s"/> were not alone.<break time="2s"/>
God had sent angels<break time="2s"/> to watch over them.<break time="2s"/>

Daylight came.<break time="1s"/>
Time went by.<break time="1s"/>
Miriam kept watching the<break time="2s"/> little basket with its secret.<break time="2s"/>
She heard the<break time="2s"/> croak of a frog.<break time="2s"/>
