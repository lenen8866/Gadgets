<break time="0.5s"/>Mother held Moses close as she<break time="2s"/> carried him home from the river.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam skipped happily<break time="2s"/> beside her mother.<break time="2s"/>

The family was glad<break time="2s"/> that their baby was safe.<break time="2s"/>
They knelt in prayer—and thanked God<break time="2s"/> for His loving care over Baby Moses.<break time="2s"/>

Now Miriam could take<break time="2s"/> him outside for a walk.<break time="2s"/>
No one would hurt him.<break time="1.8s"/>
The family knew that someday<break time="2s"/> Moses would have to go away.<break time="2s"/>
He would have to go to<break time="2s"/> live in Pharaoh’s palace with the princess.<break time="2s"/>

As Moses grew bigger,<break time="1.3s"/>
Mother Jochabed taught<break time="2s"/> him many things.<break time="2s"/>
She taught him<break time="2s"/> to read and write.<break time="2s"/>
She taught him about the God<break time="2s"/> of heaven who created the world.<break time="2s"/>
She taught him to<break time="2s"/> love God very much.<break time="2s"/>
She told him that God<break time="2s"/> had a special plan for him.<break time="2s"/>
Father Amram and Sister<break time="2s"/> Miriam taught him too.<break time="2s"/>

The family in the<break time="2s"/> little mud-brick house was happy.<break time="2s"/>
They sang songs<break time="2s"/> and prayed together.<break time="2s"/>
They never forgot how God<break time="2s"/> had saved their little boy.<break time="2s"/>
Moses and Aaron<break time="2s"/> had fun playing.<break time="2s"/>
The family walked to the Nile River and showed<break time="2s"/> Moses where he had floated in a little basket.<break time="2s"/>

Birthdays for Moses<break time="2s"/> came and went.<break time="2s"/>
Then one day<break time="2s"/> Moses had another birthday.<break time="2s"/>
He was twelve years old.<break time="1.8s"/>
It was time for him<break time="2s"/> to go away to the palace.<break time="2s"/>
The family would<break time="2s"/> miss him very much.<break time="2s"/>
Moses would miss his family,<break time="1.8s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>
But he was brave.<break time="1.3s"/>
He knew God would<break time="2s"/> take care of him.<break time="2s"/>

Before Moses left,<break time="1s"/>
the family prayed.<break time="1s"/>
They thanked God for letting<break time="2s"/> them have Moses for twelve years.<break time="2s"/>
Mother Jochabed prayed.<break time="1s"/>

Father Amram prayed.<break time="1s"/>
Moses prayed too.<break time="1s"/>
He needed God<break time="2s"/> to be near him.<break time="2s"/>
God would help him<break time="2s"/> to do the right things.<break time="2s"/>
He promised to<break time="2s"/> love God always.<break time="2s"/>

Maybe Moses went to the palace<break time="2s"/> in one of Pharaoh’s big chariots.<break time="2s"/>
It was an<break time="2s"/> exciting time for him.<break time="2s"/>
The palace was<break time="2s"/> big and very beautiful.<break time="2s"/>
Moses went all over the big<break time="2s"/> palace and out into the lovely gardens.<break time="2s"/>
He was a happy boy and<break time="2s"/> he helped to make others happy.<break time="2s"/>
The princess loved Moses.<break time="1.3s"/>
Pharaoh loved him too.<break time="1.3s"/>
They wanted him to be<break time="2s"/> the king of Egypt some day.<break time="2s"/>

Moses learned many<break time="2s"/> things in the palace.<break time="2s"/>
He learned about<break time="2s"/> the laws of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He learned how<break time="2s"/> to be a soldier.<break time="2s"/>
He learned to<break time="2s"/> drive the chariots.<break time="2s"/>

The priests tried to teach<break time="2s"/> Moses about the gods of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
But Moses kept his promise to be true to<break time="2s"/> the God of heaven and prayed to Him every day.<break time="2s"/>
