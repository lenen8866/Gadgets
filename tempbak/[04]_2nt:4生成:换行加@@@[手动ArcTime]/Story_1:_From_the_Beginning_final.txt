Long,
long ago,
there were no
 boys or girls.
There were no
 mothers or fathers.
There was no earth
 with rivers and trees.
No one was there,
but God.@@@

God has always been.
God will always be.
There is God the Father.
There is God the Son.
We call Him Jesus.
And there is
 God the Holy Spirit.
There is one
 God but three persons.@@@

God family is a
 little like our families.
A family is one family,
but there are different
 people in the family.
There is a
 father and a mother.
And there are children.@@@

God made many angels to
 live with Him in heaven,
and to work with Him.
He made this world
 and put people in it.
God wanted angels and
 people to be His friends.
