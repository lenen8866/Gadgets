<break time="0.5s"/>Nineveh was the<break time="2s"/> capital city of Assyria.<break time="2s"/>
It was a great city,<break time="1.8s"/>
but the people of<break time="2s"/> this city were wicked.<break time="2s"/>

God loved the<break time="2s"/> wicked people in Nineveh.<break time="2s"/>
He wanted them to love<break time="2s"/> Him and repent of their evil.<break time="2s"/>
So God said<break time="2s"/> to his prophet Jonah,<break time="2s"/>
“Go to Nineveh.<break time="1s"/>
Tell them that because of their wickedness I<break time="2s"/> am going to destroy their city in forty days.<break time="2s"/>
” God knew that message<break time="2s"/> would make them stop and think.<break time="2s"/>

Jonah was afraid<break time="2s"/> to go to Nineveh.<break time="2s"/>
He made a plan.<break time="1.3s"/>
He would go so far away<break time="2s"/> that God could not find him.<break time="2s"/>
For three days Jonah ran along the<break time="2s"/> shore away from Nineveh and reached Joppa,<break time="2s"/>
a seaport.<break time="1s"/>
There he got into<break time="2s"/> a ship going to Tarshish,<break time="2s"/>
a faraway city.<break time="1s"/>

Being very tired from his three-day<break time="2s"/> trip of running away from God,<break time="2s"/>
he slept in a corner<break time="2s"/> at the bottom of the ship.<break time="2s"/>
The ship started sailing.<break time="1.3s"/>

Soon great winds<break time="2s"/> began to blow.<break time="2s"/>
The ship tossed<break time="2s"/> up and down.<break time="2s"/>
The captain was afraid.<break time="1.3s"/>

Everyone in the ship shouted<break time="2s"/> to their gods for help.<break time="2s"/>
They threw the cargo<break time="2s"/> out to lighten the ship.<break time="2s"/>

But Jonah was sound asleep.<break time="1.8s"/>
The captain woke him up and asked<break time="2s"/> him to pray to his God for help.<break time="2s"/>
Then they cast lots to see<break time="2s"/> who had made the gods angry.<break time="2s"/>
The lot fell on Jonah.<break time="1.8s"/>

Jonah admitted that he was<break time="2s"/> running away from his God.<break time="2s"/>
“Throw me out<break time="2s"/> into the sea,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
They waited for a while to<break time="2s"/> see if the storm would calm down,<break time="2s"/>
but it did not.<break time="1.3s"/>
Sadly,<break time="0.5s"/>

As Jonah went down,<break time="1.3s"/>
down into the sea he<break time="2s"/> suddenly felt something warm around him.<break time="2s"/>
He was being swallowed<break time="2s"/> by a huge fish.<break time="2s"/>

For one whole day and parts of<break time="2s"/> two other days Jonah was inside the fish.<break time="2s"/>
He thought about the God whom he<break time="2s"/> had loved and served for many years.<break time="2s"/>
He promised God that<break time="2s"/> he would obey Him.<break time="2s"/>
He asked God<break time="2s"/> to save him.<break time="2s"/>

God guided the<break time="2s"/> fish to the shore.<break time="2s"/>
He caused it to vomit<break time="2s"/> out Jonah upon the sand.<break time="2s"/>
Jonah did as God<break time="2s"/> had asked him to do.<break time="2s"/>
Immediately he started<break time="2s"/> walking along the beach.<break time="2s"/>
He was going to Nineveh.<break time="1.8s"/>
