<break time="0.5s"/>Noah’s family was<break time="2s"/> safe inside the ark.<break time="2s"/>
For forty days and<break time="2s"/> nights the rain poured down.<break time="2s"/>
It came harder and harder—faster<break time="2s"/> and faster! The water got deeper.<break time="2s"/>
Noah felt the big boat<break time="2s"/> lift as it began to float.<break time="2s"/>
The water covered<break time="2s"/> even the highest mountain.<break time="2s"/>

At last the rain stopped.<break time="1.8s"/>
Big waves rocked the<break time="2s"/> ark back and forth.<break time="2s"/>
Days and weeks<break time="2s"/> and months went by.<break time="2s"/>
Little by little the<break time="2s"/> flood waters went down.<break time="2s"/>
God sent angels to guide the boat<break time="2s"/> to a place between some high mountains.<break time="2s"/>
The water was quieter there.<break time="1.8s"/>

Noah and his family were kept busy<break time="2s"/> caring for all the animals and birds.<break time="2s"/>
Strong winds were blowing so<break time="2s"/> the water was drying up.<break time="2s"/>
The boat settled high on<break time="2s"/> the side of a mountain.<break time="2s"/>
More days and weeks<break time="2s"/> and months went by.<break time="2s"/>

One day Noah let a raven<break time="2s"/> fly out through the high window.<break time="2s"/>
The raven kept<break time="2s"/> flying back and forth,<break time="2s"/>
so Noah knew the<break time="2s"/> water was still very deep.<break time="2s"/>
After a week Noah<break time="2s"/> sent out a dove.<break time="2s"/>
It came right back.<break time="1.3s"/>
Noah took the dove<break time="2s"/> back into the ark.<break time="2s"/>

After another week Noah<break time="2s"/> sent out another dove.<break time="2s"/>
It came back with<break time="2s"/> a leaf in its beak.<break time="2s"/>
Then the family knew that plants<break time="2s"/> were beginning to grow on the earth.<break time="2s"/>
Soon God would<break time="2s"/> open the door.<break time="2s"/>
After another week Noah<break time="2s"/> sent the dove out again.<break time="2s"/>
It did not come back.<break time="1.8s"/>
It had found a<break time="2s"/> resting place and food.<break time="2s"/>

After more time had passed,<break time="1.8s"/>
Noah heard God’s voice.<break time="1.3s"/>
“It is time to<break time="2s"/> come out of the ark,<break time="2s"/>
” He said.<break time="1s"/>
“Bring out your family and<break time="2s"/> all the animals and birds.<break time="2s"/>

God sent His angel<break time="2s"/> to open the door.<break time="2s"/>
Slowly the big<break time="2s"/> door swung open.<break time="2s"/>
Noah and his family walked out of the<break time="2s"/> ark into the fresh air and warm sunshine.<break time="2s"/>
They had been in the<break time="2s"/> ark for a long time.<break time="2s"/>

All the animals came<break time="2s"/> out of the ark.<break time="2s"/>
They were happy to be<break time="2s"/> able to run and jump.<break time="2s"/>
The birds went flying away,<break time="1.8s"/>
high in the sky.<break time="1.3s"/>

Soon the animals<break time="2s"/> had gone away.<break time="2s"/>
But some animals,<break time="1s"/>
like cats and dogs,<break time="1.3s"/>
sheep and goats,<break time="1s"/>
stayed near the people.<break time="1.3s"/>

The first thing Noah’s family did when they came out<break time="2s"/> of the ark was to thank God for keeping them safe.<break time="2s"/>
Then they saw a bright<break time="2s"/> rainbow shining across the sky.<break time="2s"/>
They had never<break time="2s"/> seen a rainbow before.<break time="2s"/>
God told them the rainbow<break time="2s"/> was a promise for them.<break time="2s"/>
He would not send another<break time="2s"/> flood to cover the whole earth.<break time="2s"/>
They knew God loved<break time="2s"/> and cared for them.<break time="2s"/>

The family started<break time="2s"/> to make their homes.<break time="2s"/>
Soon grass and<break time="2s"/> flowers began to grow.<break time="2s"/>
The world became beautiful again.<break time="1.8s"/>
