<break time="0.5s"/>It was very<break time="2s"/> early in the morning.<break time="2s"/>
Pharaoh,<break time="0.5s"/>
the king of Egypt,<break time="1.3s"/>
could not sleep.<break time="1s"/>
He kept thinking of the<break time="2s"/> dreams he had just had.<break time="2s"/>
What strange dreams! What could<break time="2s"/> they mean? He couldn’t sleep.<break time="2s"/>
Better get up.<break time="1s"/>
He would call his<break time="2s"/> wise men to the palace.<break time="2s"/>
They would tell him<break time="2s"/> what these dreams meant.<break time="2s"/>

“Bring all my wise men,<break time="1.8s"/>
” he told his servants.<break time="1.8s"/>
Horses galloped through the streets bringing<break time="2s"/> these important men to the palace.<break time="2s"/>

Soon Pharaoh was<break time="2s"/> in his throne room.<break time="2s"/>
His sleepy wise<break time="2s"/> men were there.<break time="2s"/>
They were all<break time="2s"/> looking at Pharaoh.<break time="2s"/>
They were thinking,<break time="1s"/>

Pharaoh said,<break time="1s"/>
“I had two<break time="2s"/> very strange dreams.<break time="2s"/>
I cannot rest until<break time="2s"/> I know what they mean.<break time="2s"/>
In my first dream I<break time="2s"/> was standing by the Nile River.<break time="2s"/>
I saw seven cows<break time="2s"/> come out of the river.<break time="2s"/>
They were nice fat cows.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Then seven more<break time="2s"/> cows came out.<break time="2s"/>
There have never been such<break time="2s"/> ugly cows in all Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
They were so skinny that all<break time="2s"/> their bones seemed to be sticking out.<break time="2s"/>

“Then a very<break time="2s"/> strange thing happened.<break time="2s"/>
The skinny cows ate<break time="2s"/> up the fat cows.<break time="2s"/>
But they were still skinny.<break time="1.8s"/>

“Then I had another dream.<break time="1.8s"/>
I saw seven heads<break time="2s"/> of grain on one stem.<break time="2s"/>
The kernels of<break time="2s"/> grain looked very good.<break time="2s"/>
There were seven more heads<break time="2s"/> of grain on the same stem.<break time="2s"/>
These did not look good<break time="2s"/> and had little dried-up kernels.<break time="2s"/>
The poor-looking heads ate<break time="2s"/> up the good ones.<break time="2s"/>
They didn’t look any better.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then I woke up.<break time="1.3s"/>
I have called you here to<break time="2s"/> tell me what my dreams mean.<break time="2s"/>

The room was very quiet.<break time="1.8s"/>
No one said anything.<break time="1.3s"/>
Pharaoh waited.<break time="1s"/>
Some of the king’s helpers tried<break time="2s"/> to act as if they were thinking.<break time="2s"/>
“Tell me!” shouted Pharaoh.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Someone tell me what the<break time="2s"/> dreams mean!” No one said anything.<break time="2s"/>

“Please tell me<break time="2s"/> what my dreams mean.<break time="2s"/>
Is it good or<break time="2s"/> bad?” Pharaoh asked again.<break time="2s"/>
No one answered.<break time="1s"/>



The butler came to<break time="2s"/> bring Pharaoh a drink.<break time="2s"/>
When he heard<break time="2s"/> about the king’s dreams,<break time="2s"/>

He bowed low<break time="2s"/> before the king.<break time="2s"/>
Then he told about<break time="2s"/> his dream in the prison.<break time="2s"/>
He told about<break time="2s"/> the baker’s dream too.<break time="2s"/>
And he told about Joseph.<break time="1.8s"/>
“There was a<break time="2s"/> slave in the prison,<break time="2s"/>
” he said.<break time="1s"/>
“He told us<break time="2s"/> what our dreams meant,<break time="2s"/>
and it all came true.<break time="1.8s"/>

Pharaoh stood up.<break time="1s"/>
“Find that prisoner.<break time="1s"/>
