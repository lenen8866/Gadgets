Esau was very angry when he
 found out Jacob had tricked his father.
Isaac had given the
 birthright blessing to Jacob.
“I will hurt
 Jacob for this,
” he said.@@@

Rebekah found out
 about Esau’s angry words.
She called Jacob to her.
“My son,
” she said,
“Your brother wants
 to hurt you.
Go away quickly to
 my brother’s house in Haran.
When Esau gets
 over his anger,
I will send someone to tell
 you to come back to me.
” Jacob said
 good-bye to his father.
Jacob and his mother
 cried when they said good-bye.
They did not know that they
 would never see each other again.@@@

Jacob was sad and
 afraid as he hurried away.
Soon it was dark,
but he kept going.
He was afraid that Esau would
 come after him and kill him.
He knew he had done
 wrong to lie to his father.
He should have trusted God
 to take care of the birthright.@@@

“I am alone
 without Mother or Father,
” he cried.
“Even God is not
 with me any more.
” All the next
 day he hurried on.
He didn’t want
 anyone to see him.
They might tell
 Esau where he was.
He found a place in
 the woods to spend the night.
He felt he
 could not pray.
He could not sleep.
Then he began calling to
 God to forgive his sins.
At last,
with his head on
 a rock for a pillow,
he fell asleep.@@@

God had been with
 Jacob all the time.
He had not left him.
He felt very
 sorry for Jacob.
He was glad that Jacob was
 sorry for what he had done.
Now God did
 something special for him.
He gave Jacob
 a beautiful dream.
Jacob saw the bottom of a
 ladder on the ground right beside him.
It went up,
up until the top
 of the ladder reached heaven.
Beautiful angels were going
 up and down the ladder.
At the very
 top was God Himself.
God talked to
 Jacob in the dream.
He said,
“I am with you.
I will take care
 of you wherever you go.
I will bring you
 back to this land.
I will not leave you.@@@

Jacob woke up happy.
“Surely the Lord is in this
 place and I didn’t know it.
God is with me.
He has forgiven my sins.
I will have only
 you for my God,
” he promised.
Before he left he set up the
 stone he had used for a pillow.
He named the place Bethel,
which means “house of God.
” Then he went
 happily on his way.
He was sure that
 God was with him.@@@

It was a long way
 to his Uncle Laban’s house.
Jacob walked and walked.
When he got there,
his Uncle Laban was
 very happy to see him.
Jacob stayed there a long
 time and worked for Laban.
God blessed all
 of Jacob’s work.@@@

He got married
 and had children.
Then he decided to go
 back to his home in Canaan.
His mother had died,
but his father
 was still alive.@@@

Jacob was afraid of
 meeting his brother Esau.
Before they met,
Jacob prayed all night.
The next morning Esau forgave him
 and the brothers were friends again.
