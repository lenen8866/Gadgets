One day Moses saw a slave<break time="2s"/> master hit an Israelite slave very hard.<break time="2s"/>
Moses got angry.<break time="1s"/>
He killed the slave master.<break time="1.8s"/>
But that was not the<break time="2s"/> way God wanted him to help.<break time="2s"/>

Somebody told the king<break time="2s"/> what Moses had done.<break time="2s"/>

King Pharaoh was angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
Moses was afraid and<break time="2s"/> ran away from the palace.<break time="2s"/>
He ran away from Egypt.<break time="1.8s"/>
He felt sad.<break time="1s"/>
He thought that now God could<break time="2s"/> not use him to help the people.<break time="2s"/>
He knew it was wrong<break time="2s"/> to kill the slave master.<break time="2s"/>
He prayed,<break time="1s"/>
