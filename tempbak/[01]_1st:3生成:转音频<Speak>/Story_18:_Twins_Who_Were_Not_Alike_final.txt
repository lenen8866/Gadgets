<break time="0.5s"/>One happy day Isaac<break time="2s"/> and Rebekah had twins.<break time="2s"/>
Two little boys!<break time="2s"/> Rebekah was not surprised.<break time="2s"/>
An angel had told her she would have twin<break time="2s"/> sons and the older one would serve the younger.<break time="2s"/>
Esau was born first.<break time="1.3s"/>

The two little<break time="2s"/> boys were very different.<break time="2s"/>
Esau liked to<break time="2s"/> play rough games.<break time="2s"/>
He liked to go out<break time="2s"/> in the fields and forests.<break time="2s"/>
He liked to go hunting.<break time="1.8s"/>
Isaac loved Esau best.<break time="1.3s"/>

Jacob was quiet and<break time="2s"/> liked being at home.<break time="2s"/>
He liked taking care of<break time="2s"/> the sheep and planting a garden.<break time="2s"/>
He liked to hear Grandfather Abraham<break time="2s"/> tell stories about the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
Rebekah loved Jacob best.<break time="1.3s"/>

In those times,<break time="1s"/>
in each family,<break time="1s"/>
the first boy born<break time="2s"/> was to get the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
That meant that he would be the<break time="2s"/> one to help his family worship God.<break time="2s"/>
Esau,<break time="0.5s"/>
the firstborn,<break time="1s"/>
did not care<break time="2s"/> much about the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
Jacob,<break time="0.5s"/>
the younger son,<break time="1s"/>
often wished that he<break time="2s"/> could have the birthright.<break time="2s"/>

The boys grew<break time="2s"/> to be young men.<break time="2s"/>
One day Jacob was<break time="2s"/> making some good food.<break time="2s"/>
He was cooking some lentils.<break time="1.8s"/>
Esau came back from<break time="2s"/> hunting and was very hungry.<break time="2s"/>
He came right to Jacob’s<break time="2s"/> tent where the food was cooking.<break time="2s"/>
“I’m very hungry,<break time="1s"/>
” he told his brother,<break time="1.8s"/>
“Please give me<break time="2s"/> some of your food.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob got an idea.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
” he said<break time="2s"/> to his brother.<break time="2s"/>
“Give me your birthright and you<break time="2s"/> can have all the food you want.<break time="2s"/>
” Right then,<break time="1s"/>
Esau cared more about getting<break time="2s"/> food than having the birthright.<break time="2s"/>
So he said yes.<break time="1.3s"/>
Jacob gave him the food.<break time="1.8s"/>

Many years passed by before<break time="2s"/> Esau remembered about the birthright again.<break time="2s"/>
He did not<break time="2s"/> care about God,<break time="2s"/>
but Jacob loved<break time="2s"/> the God of heaven.<break time="2s"/>
