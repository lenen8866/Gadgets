<break time="0.5s"/>Fire! Red and yellow flames! What could be<break time="2s"/> burning? “Are all the sheep safe?” Moses wondered.<break time="2s"/>
He looked at<break time="2s"/> the fire again.<break time="2s"/>
Bright flames were coming from<break time="2s"/> the middle of a thorn bush.<break time="2s"/>
But the bush<break time="2s"/> was green and pretty.<break time="2s"/>
“How can that<break time="2s"/> be?” Moses asked.<break time="2s"/>
He walked very<break time="2s"/> slowly—closer to the bush.<break time="2s"/>

“Moses! Moses!” a voice called.<break time="1.8s"/>
“Yes,<break time="0.5s"/>
I am here,<break time="1s"/>
” Moses answered.<break time="1s"/>

“Don’t come near.<break time="1s"/>
Take off your shoes.<break time="1.3s"/>
You are standing<break time="2s"/> on holy ground.<break time="2s"/>
I am the<break time="2s"/> God of Abraham,<break time="2s"/>
Isaac,<break time="0.5s"/>
and Jacob.<break time="1s"/>
” Moses quickly<break time="2s"/> took off his shoes.<break time="2s"/>
He covered his<break time="2s"/> face in reverence.<break time="2s"/>

God spoke again.<break time="1s"/>
“I have seen the troubles<break time="2s"/> of the Israelite people in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
I have heard their prayers.<break time="1.8s"/>
I will bring my people out<break time="2s"/> of Egypt to a good land.<break time="2s"/>
Moses,<break time="0.5s"/>
I have chosen you to<break time="2s"/> lead the people out of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Go to the new Pharaoh and<break time="2s"/> tell him to let My people go.<break time="2s"/>

“Who am I?”<break time="2s"/> Moses asked God.<break time="2s"/>
“I am only<break time="2s"/> a poor shepherd.<break time="2s"/>
I am not the<break time="2s"/> one to help the people.<break time="2s"/>

“Don’t be afraid,<break time="1s"/>
” God said.<break time="1s"/>
“I will be with you.<break time="1.8s"/>

“I forgot how to<break time="2s"/> speak the language of Egypt,<break time="2s"/>
” Moses said.<break time="1s"/>

“I will be with your mouth<break time="2s"/> and teach you what to say,<break time="2s"/>
” God said.<break time="1s"/>
“Your brother,<break time="1s"/>
Aaron,<break time="0.5s"/>
is on his<break time="2s"/> way to meet you.<break time="2s"/>
He will help you.<break time="1.3s"/>

Moses obeyed God.<break time="1s"/>
He took the sheep home.<break time="1.8s"/>
Then he got<break time="2s"/> ready for the trip.<break time="2s"/>
He said good-bye to his family<break time="2s"/> and started on his way to Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
