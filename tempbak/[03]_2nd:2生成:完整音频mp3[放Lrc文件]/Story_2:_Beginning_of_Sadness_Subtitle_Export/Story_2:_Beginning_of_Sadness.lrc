[00:00.00]God made a special angel named Lucifer.
[00:05.48] 
[00:05.48]He was very beautiful.
[00:08.57] 
[00:08.57]He was a leader of the other angels in heaven.
[00:15.03] 
[00:15.03]He led the choir.
[00:17.42] 
[00:17.42]All the angels loved Lucifer.<br>
[00:22.06] 
[00:22.06]Little by little,pip install aeneas
[00:24.45] 
[00:24.45]Lucifer began to think about how special he was.
[00:31.19] 
[00:31.19]"I am the most beautiful and the wisest angel of all,
[00:38.63] 
[00:38.63]" he said.<br>
[00:40.60] 
[00:40.60]God the Father and God the Son had a meeting.
[00:46.92] 
[00:46.92]"Why didnâ€™t they invite me to the meeting?" Lucifer thought.
[00:55.35] 
[00:55.35]"I am a very special angel.
[00:59.15] 
[00:59.15]" Lucifer was jealous of God the Son.<br>
[01:04.91] 
[01:04.91]Then Lucifer started to talk to the other angels.
[01:11.79] 
[01:11.79]"God is not fair,
[01:14.18] 
[01:14.18]" he said.
[01:15.58] 
[01:15.58]"He likes the Son better than me.
[01:20.22] 
[01:20.22]" The angels were surprised.
[01:24.15] 
[01:24.15]They loved God.
[01:26.26] 
[01:26.26]But slowly,
[01:27.81] 
[01:27.81]some of the angels believed Lucifer.<br>
[01:33.43] 
[01:33.43]God the Father and the Son talked with Lucifer.
[01:40.03] 
[01:40.03]They tried to help him.
[01:43.26] 
[01:43.26]But Lucifer wanted to be like God.
[01:48.04] 
[01:48.04]A being God had made could not be like Him.<br>
[01:54.64] 
[01:54.64]At last,
[01:55.76] 
[01:55.76]God had to send Lucifer out of heaven.
[02:01.10] 
[02:01.10]Many of the angels went with him.
[02:05.74] 
[02:05.74]It was a very sad time in heaven.<br>
[02:10.94] 
[02:10.94]Now Lucifer chose to be an angel of lies and hate.
[02:17.96] 
[02:17.96]He was called Satan.
[02:20.77] 
[02:20.77]He wanted to do everything he could against God.
[02:27.52] 
[02:27.52]He wanted angels and people to be on his side.
[02:33.98] 
[02:33.98]He wants you to be on his side,
[02:38.33] 
[02:38.33]too.
[02:38.90] 
[02:38.90]We should not listen to Satan.
[02:43.11]
