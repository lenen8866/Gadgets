<break time="0.5s"/>Shh! Don’t tell<break time="2s"/> anyone! It’s a secret.<break time="2s"/>
Did you ever have a secret? Miriam<break time="2s"/> was a little girl who had a secret.<break time="2s"/>
She was twelve years old and lived<break time="2s"/> in a little mud-brick house in Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
Her father,<break time="1s"/>
Amram,<break time="0.5s"/>
knew the secret.<break time="1s"/>
Her mother,<break time="1s"/>
Jochabed,<break time="0.5s"/>
knew the secret too.<break time="1.3s"/>
Even her little brother,<break time="1.3s"/>
Aaron,<break time="0.5s"/>
knew about it.<break time="1s"/>
The secret was<break time="2s"/> a happy one.<break time="2s"/>
There was a new baby brother in<break time="2s"/> their house! The baby’s name was Moses.<break time="2s"/>
But the secret<break time="2s"/> made the family afraid.<break time="2s"/>

A new Pharaoh was<break time="2s"/> the king of Egypt.<break time="2s"/>
He did not<break time="2s"/> like the Israelite people.<break time="2s"/>
He made them his slaves.<break time="1.8s"/>
Father Amram had to<break time="2s"/> work very hard for Pharaoh.<break time="2s"/>
Sometimes the king’s helpers<break time="2s"/> would beat the slaves.<break time="2s"/>

Pharaoh thought there<break time="2s"/> were too many Israelites.<break time="2s"/>
He made a very<break time="2s"/> sad and scary rule.<break time="2s"/>
All the baby boys were to<break time="2s"/> be thrown into the River Nile.<break time="2s"/>
That is why the new<break time="2s"/> baby must be a secret.<break time="2s"/>
If Pharaoh and his men<break time="2s"/> would find out about the baby,<break time="2s"/>
they would take him away.<break time="1.8s"/>

Moses grew bigger and bigger.<break time="1.8s"/>
He was big enough<break time="2s"/> to make happy baby sounds.<break time="2s"/>
He was big<break time="2s"/> enough to cry loudly.<break time="2s"/>
Whenever an Egyptian<break time="2s"/> guard passed the house,<break time="2s"/>
the family was afraid.<break time="1.3s"/>
They tried to<break time="2s"/> keep the baby quiet.<break time="2s"/>

One morning Mother Jochabed said,<break time="1.8s"/>
“We cannot hide<break time="2s"/> our secret much longer.<break time="2s"/>
Someone will hear Moses crying and will<break time="2s"/> know there is a baby in our house.<break time="2s"/>
” The family did<break time="2s"/> not know what to do.<break time="2s"/>

Father Amram said,<break time="1s"/>
“We will pray to God.<break time="1.8s"/>
He will help us.<break time="1.3s"/>

The family prayed together.<break time="1.3s"/>
“Dear God,<break time="1s"/>
” said Father,<break time="1s"/>
“please help us to know what<break time="2s"/> to do to save our baby.<break time="2s"/>

God had a plan<break time="2s"/> for the little baby.<break time="2s"/>
He helped Mother Jochabed<break time="2s"/> think of the plan.<break time="2s"/>
The River Nile was<break time="2s"/> not far from the village.<break time="2s"/>
Some tall reeds grew on<break time="2s"/> the banks of the river.<break time="2s"/>
Mother took some of the<break time="2s"/> reeds and wove a basket.<break time="2s"/>
Miriam helped put pitch on<break time="2s"/> the outside of the basket.<break time="2s"/>

“The pitch will<break time="2s"/> keep the water out,<break time="2s"/>
” Mother told Miriam.<break time="1.3s"/>
“We will put<break time="2s"/> Moses in the basket.<break time="2s"/>
We will put the<break time="2s"/> basket in the river.<break time="2s"/>
You will hide in<break time="2s"/> the reeds to watch him.<break time="2s"/>

“But,<break time="0.5s"/>
Mother,<break time="0.5s"/>
” Miriam began to cry.<break time="1.8s"/>
“I’m afraid something bad will<break time="2s"/> happen to my little brother.<break time="2s"/>

Mother hugged Miriam.<break time="1s"/>
“We must do our<break time="2s"/> best to save Moses,<break time="2s"/>
” she said,<break time="1s"/>
“God loves him too.<break time="1.3s"/>
He will send angels<break time="2s"/> to watch over him.<break time="2s"/>
