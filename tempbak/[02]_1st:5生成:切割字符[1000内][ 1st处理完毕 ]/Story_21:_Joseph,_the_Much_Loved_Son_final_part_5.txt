Joseph loved the little lambs.<break time="1.8s"/>
He was very<break time="2s"/> kind to them.<break time="2s"/>
But his brothers<break time="2s"/> were not kind.<break time="2s"/>
And they were not careful.<break time="1.8s"/>
If a lamb got lost,<break time="1.8s"/>
they did not care.<break time="1.3s"/>
This made Joseph sad.<break time="1.3s"/>
He told his<break time="2s"/> father about it.<break time="2s"/>
That made the<break time="2s"/> brothers angry at Joseph.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob loved Joseph the<break time="2s"/> best of all his sons.<break time="2s"/>
He made a<break time="2s"/> special coat for Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
It was the kind of<break time="2s"/> coat that kings and princes wear.<break time="2s"/>
It was a coat<break time="2s"/> with many pretty colors.<break time="2s"/>

Jacob gave the<break time="2s"/> coat to Joseph.<break time="2s"/>
