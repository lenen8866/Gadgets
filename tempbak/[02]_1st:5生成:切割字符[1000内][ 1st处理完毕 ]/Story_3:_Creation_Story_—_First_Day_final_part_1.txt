<break time="0.5s"/>Pretend that you are holding a<break time="2s"/> ball of nothing in your hand.<break time="2s"/>
Now take this ball of<break time="2s"/> nothing and make a beautiful rose.<break time="2s"/>
Make it smell very nice.<break time="1.8s"/>
Give it green leaves.<break time="1.3s"/>
Then make it grow.<break time="1.3s"/>
Can you do that?<break time="2s"/> Of course you cannot.<break time="2s"/>
Only God can create<break time="2s"/> something out of nothing.<break time="2s"/>

Long ago God decided<break time="2s"/> to make a new world.<break time="2s"/>
That new world was<break time="2s"/> our earth where we live.<break time="2s"/>
In the beginning the<break time="2s"/> earth had no shape.<break time="2s"/>
Darkness covered the deep water.<break time="1.8s"/>
There was no light.<break time="1.3s"/>
No sun or moon<break time="2s"/> or stars could be seen.<break time="2s"/>
Then God spoke,<break time="1s"/>
