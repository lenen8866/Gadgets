<break time="0.5s"/>The people walked<break time="2s"/> for two days.<break time="2s"/>
They were tired,<break time="1s"/>
but they were free.<break time="1.3s"/>
And they were happy.<break time="1.3s"/>

Night was coming again.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was time<break time="2s"/> to stop walking.<break time="2s"/>
It was time to rest.<break time="1.8s"/>
Fathers put up tents.<break time="1.3s"/>
Mothers cooked food.<break time="1s"/>
The people were<break time="2s"/> ready to sleep.<break time="2s"/>
The sun went down.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was getting dark.<break time="1.3s"/>
It was getting cold,<break time="1.3s"/>
too.<break time="0.5s"/>

Then something wonderful happened.<break time="1.3s"/>
Everyone stopped what<break time="2s"/> they were doing.<break time="2s"/>
They looked up<break time="2s"/> into the sky.<break time="2s"/>
There was a long<break time="2s"/> cloud like a pillar.<break time="2s"/>
