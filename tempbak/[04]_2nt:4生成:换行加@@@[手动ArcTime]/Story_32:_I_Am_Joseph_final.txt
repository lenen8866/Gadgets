Joseph was glad when he
 saw all the brothers come back.
Now he knew that
 his brothers had changed.@@@

The brothers bowed down on
 the floor in front of Joseph.
“We will all
 be your slaves,
” they said.@@@

“No,
” said Joseph.
“Only Benjamin has to stay.
You can all go home.@@@

Then Judah came closer to Joseph
 and kneeled in front of him.
“If we go
 back without Benjamin,
our father will die,
” he said.
“Please let me stay in
 his place as your slave forever.
Let him go
 home to his father.
” Joseph could
 hardly keep from crying.
This was Judah,
the same brother who had told
 the brothers to sell Joseph years ago.
Now he was
 unselfish and kind.@@@

“Leave the room,
” Joseph said
 to all his servants.
When they had gone,
Joseph cried out loud.@@@

“I am Joseph,
” he said.@@@

Joseph! How could this be Joseph?
 “But he is speaking our language,
” one of
 the brothers said.
“Now he will punish us
 for what we did to him.@@@

But Joseph spoke
 kindly to them.
“Don’t be angry with
 yourselves for selling me.
This was God’s
 plan for my life.
God wanted me to teach the people
 of Egypt about the God of heaven.
He wanted me to
 keep many people from starving.
We have had two
 bad years of famine.
There will be five more
 years when nothing can grow.
Now go back and tell my
 father that I am still alive.
I want Father and all of
 you to come to Egypt to live.
Then you will
 have food to eat.
Come to Egypt and
 bring everything that you have.@@@

Then Joseph put his arms around
 Benjamin and they both cried for happiness.
Then,
one by one,
Joseph went to each
 brother and kissed him.
Each one asked
 Joseph to forgive him.
Joseph was happy to forgive.@@@

Joseph sent wagons and
 drivers with the brothers.
The women and children and
 Father Jacob could ride to Egypt.
Joseph sent food and
 presents to his father too.@@@

When the brothers got home
 they hurried into Father Jacob’s tent.
“Joseph is alive,
” they cried.
“He is governor of Egypt.
He wants you to come to Egypt right away!” Then the
 brothers told Jacob what they had done to Joseph many years ago.
They were very sorry.
Jacob could not believe that
 his son Joseph was still alive.@@@

“It is true,
Father.
See all the wagons
 Joseph sent from Egypt.
He wants you to
 have a good trip.
Look at all the
 presents he sent you.@@@

At last Jacob believed that his son was
 really alive! He couldn’t wait to see him again.@@@

And so the happy day came
 when Jacob and his much loved son,
Joseph,
were together again.
When Jacob saw Joseph,
he said,
“I have seen you.
You are still alive.
Now I am
 ready to die.
” But Jacob
 did not die.
He lived a
 long time after this.
The years he lived in Egypt near
 Joseph were the happiest years of his life.
