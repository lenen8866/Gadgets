<break time="0.5s"/>It could be seen<break time="2s"/> on the fourth day.<break time="2s"/>
It is really a sun.<break time="1.8s"/>
It is very far away.<break time="1.8s"/>
You cannot see<break time="2s"/> it in the daytime.<break time="2s"/>
You can see<break time="2s"/> it in the night.<break time="2s"/>
There are so many of<break time="2s"/> them you cannot count them.<break time="2s"/>

The beautiful plants that<break time="2s"/> God had created needed sunshine.<break time="2s"/>
So on the<break time="2s"/> fourth day God said,<break time="2s"/>
"Let there be<break time="2s"/> lights in the sky.<break time="2s"/>
" The clouds moved away<break time="2s"/> and there was the sun,<break time="2s"/>
a very big<break time="2s"/> ball of fire.<break time="2s"/>
For the first time the<break time="2s"/> warm sunlight shone on the earth.<break time="2s"/>
It touched the plants.<break time="1.3s"/>
They began to grow.<break time="1.3s"/>
