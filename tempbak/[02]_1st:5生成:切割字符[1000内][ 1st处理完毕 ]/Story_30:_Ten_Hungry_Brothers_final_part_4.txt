but he acted angry.<break time="1.3s"/>
“No,<break time="0.5s"/>
you are spies,<break time="1s"/>
” he said again.<break time="1.3s"/>
“You cannot leave Egypt<break time="2s"/> until your brother comes here.<break time="2s"/>
Then I will know<break time="2s"/> that you are not lying.<break time="2s"/>
One of you may go<break time="2s"/> home and get your brother.<break time="2s"/>
